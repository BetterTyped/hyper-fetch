# TODO IMPORTANT - CACHE KEY PROBLEM FOR onValue, onSnapshot, possibly for others - problem with request endpoint? # MACIEJ
# Handle adding/removing snapshot from additionalData - should it be there or not by default
# Handle listening on changes/added/removed
# Check what happens if passing collection to doc methods
# Add emptyResource status if no data returned.
# Double check passing filtering to every method
# TODO - observe only on changed/remove/added for onSnapshot
# RealtimeDB remember about push changes array to object with some strange indexes
# TODO - add collection group!
# TODO - check if set method for Realtime may allow for setting multiple objects
