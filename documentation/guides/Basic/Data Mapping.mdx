We often encounter the need to `map` data before sending data to server. This is usually required for two reasons. One
of them are `breaking changes to the server api`, which may require many changes, which may be dangerous for the
application and introduce **feature regression**. Another case is sending `FormData`, which is impossible to represent
in the form of an exact interface in terms of the fields it contains. In order not to send something that is equivalent
to the type `any`, we can specify the correct type in the command and then map everything to FormData just before it
gets added to **[Dispatcher](/docs/Docs/Dispatcher)**. In this way, we ensure very safe typing and flexibility in
developing our application.

#### FormData example

```ts
export const postUserProfile = builder
  .createCommand<boolean, UserProfile>()({
    method: "PATCH",
    endpoint: "/users/profile/:userId",
  })
  .setDataMapper((data) => {
    // Transform data:UserProfile into FormData
    const formData = new FormData();

    Object.entries(([key, value]) => {
      formData.append(key, value);
    });

    // Return new data format
    return formData;
  });
```
