Canceling requests happens in many places in Hyper Fetch. There are cases when we make the request, abort it and remove
from the dispatcher storage (manual aborting) or the case when it stays in memory to be triggered later again (stop
sending the request, stopping the queue).

#### Dispatcher built-in queue/request stoping

When we stop sending all requests from further on in the queue, we do not want them to be deleted, but canceled, so that
we can resume them at any time we choose.

```ts
// Make a request to server
postFile.send()

...

// Stop the request from being send for later
// Do not delete it from storage to trigger it later
builder.fetchDispatcher.stop(postFile.queueKey)

...

// Start sending again
builder.fetchDispatcher.start(postFile.queueKey)
```

#### Dispatcher cancelable mode

One of the dispatcher's modes is `cancelable` one. It causes that calling a request while the previous one is in
progress, we cancel it and let us finish the one just called. To enable this mode, we need to set the `cancelable: true`
field to command options.

```ts
const getUsers = builder.createCommand<UsersList>()({  endpoint: "/users", cancelable: true });

// Make a request to server
getUsers.send()
...
// Cancel the previous request and trigger new one
getUsers.send()
```

#### Manual cancelation by abortKey

Each command has its own abortKey, which may be the same across request groups. Thanks to it, we have the ability to
abort ongoing requests.

<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="React" label="React" default>

```tsx
// With useFetch
const { abort } = useFetch();

abort();

// With useSubmit
const { abort, submit } = useSubmit();

submit();
...
abort();
```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="Typescript" label="Typescript" default>

```ts
// Make a request to server
getUsers.send()
...
// Cancel the previous request
getUsers.abort()
```

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>
