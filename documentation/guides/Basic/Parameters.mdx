Url parameters are detected automatically thanks to typescript, which makes it very convenient to manage them and detect
regression. The assumption is very simple, our parameter to be completed should consist of two parts `:` and a `name`,
such as: `:userId` or `:productId`. We place them in the enpoint string when we initialize command.

### Setting url parameters

You can set query params by using the `setQueryParams` method on command. It's type can be configured on command
creation.

```ts
const getUsers = builder.createCommand()({ endpoint: "/users/:userId" });

getUsers.setParams({ userId: "John" });
```

```ts
const getUsers = builder.createCommand()({ endpoint: "/entities/:categoryId/:productId" });

getUsers.setParams({ categoryId: 12, productId: "Z24PBW443" });
```
