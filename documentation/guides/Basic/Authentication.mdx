Authentication in Hyper Fetch consists of two steps. We will introduce changes in the **[Builder](/docs/Docs/Builder)**
instance and subsequent commands created from it.

---

#### The first is to determine the impact on the command sent like on the example below.

```tsx
export const builder = new Builder({ baseUrl }).onAuth((command) => {
  // Redux store or any other storage to get current value of token
  const state = store.getState();
  const authToken = state.auth.token;

  // For every authenticated command we want to
  // add the header with token and return the extended command
  return command.setHeaders({
    ...command.headers,
    Authorization: `Bearer ${authToken}`,
  });
});
```

#### The second step is to put the `auth: true` option in the command to make it available for `onAuth` method of builder.

```tsx
export const getUsers = builder.createCommand()({
  endpoint: "/users",
  auth: true,
});
```

That's it, from now on, each request made using this command will be authenticated.
