Canceling requests happens in many places in Hyper Fetch. There are cases when we make the request and we want to abort
it manually or the case when queue is aborting it when we stop it, but then it's not removed from memory and it wait for
next trigger.

#### Dispatcher cancelable mode

One of the dispatcher's modes is `cancelable` one. It is triggered when previous request is in progress and we trigger
the new one and cancel previous at the same time to prevent `race-conditioning` of the responses. To enable this mode,
we need to set the `cancelable: true` field to command options.

```ts
const getUsers = builder.createCommand<UsersList>()({  endpoint: "/users", cancelable: true });

// Make a request to server
getUsers.send()
...
// Cancel the previous request and trigger new one
getUsers.send()
```

#### Manual cancelation by abortKey

Each command has its own abortKey, which may be the same across request groups. Thanks to it, we have the ability to
abort ongoing requests.

<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="React" label="React" default>

```tsx
// With useFetch
const { abort } = useFetch();

abort();

// With useSubmit
const { abort, submit } = useSubmit();

submit();
...
abort();
```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="Typescript" label="Typescript" default>

```ts
// Make a request to server
getUsers.send()
...
// Cancel the previous request
getUsers.abort()
```

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

#### Dispatcher built-in queue/request stoping

When we stop sending all requests from further on in the queue, we do not want them to be deleted, but canceled, so that
we can resume them at any time we choose.

```ts
// Make a request to server
postFile.send()

...

// Stop the request from being send for later
// Do not delete it from storage to trigger it later
builder.fetchDispatcher.stop(postFile.queueKey)

...

// Start sending again
builder.fetchDispatcher.start(postFile.queueKey)
```
