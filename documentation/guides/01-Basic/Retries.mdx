**Retries** are set on the command, we can define their number and the interval between subsequent dispatches. We can
add these options while creating the command or through the `setRetry` and `setRetryTime` methods.

### Example

```ts
const createUser = builder.createCommand()({ endpoint: "/users", retry: 4, retryTime: DateInterval.second * 3 });

// OR

const newCommand = createUser.setRetry(1).setRetryTime(DateInterval.minute);
```
