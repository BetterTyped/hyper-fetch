### Use global defaults for command

To significantly limit the setup of our application, we can add global configs. To get the greatest flexibility in the
context of the created configurations in larger and more complex applications, they are added through callbacks based on
command data. Thanks to this, we can, for example, make one default configuration for requests using the get method and
another for the others.

It is worth remembering that global configurations are overwritten by command settings, so the options that we set will
be applied only to commands that do not have them specified in their options.

### Example

```ts
export const builder = new Builder({ baseUrl }).setCommandConfig((commandOptions) => {
  if (commandOptions.method === "GET") {
    return {
      deduplicate: true,
      cacheTime: 20000,
      retry: 3,
    };
  }

  return {
    deduplicate: false,
    cache: false,
    retry: 0,
  };
});
```
