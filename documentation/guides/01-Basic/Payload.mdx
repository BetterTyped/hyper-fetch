Adding data to the requests is pretty simple in Hyper Fetch. Use the `setData` method on the command and set whatever
data you want to transfer.

---

### Example

```ts
const createUser = builder.createCommand()({ method: "POST", endpoint: "/users" });

const command = createUser.setData({ name: "Maciej" });
console.log(command.data); // Output: { name: "Maciej" }
```
