### Initialize Builder

The first step is to initialize the **[Builder](/docs/Architecture/Builder)**. It manage the basic configuration for
connection to the server and all the elements that make up Hyper Fetch, which are instances of - **dispatchers**,
**cache** and **app managers**. We start by determining the `baseUrl` of our server.

```tsx title="/src/server/builder.ts"
import { Builder } from "@better-typed/hyper-fetch";

export const builder = new Builder({ baseUrl: "http://localhost:3000" });
```

### Create Command

Then, having already prepared connection setup for the server, we use the builder method to create
**[commands](/docs/Architecture/Command)** and assign types to them.

:::caution

We are using currying to achieve auto generated types for the endpoint string. <br /> This solution will be removed once
[https://github.com/microsoft/TypeScript/issues/10571](https://github.com/microsoft/TypeScript/issues/10571) get
resolved.

:::

```tsx title="/src/server/auth/auth.ts"
import { builder } from "../builder.ts";

type ResponseType = { token: string; refreshToken: string };
type RequestType = { email: string; password: string };

const postLogin = builder.createCommand<ResponseType, RequestType>()({ method: "POST", endpoint: "/auth/login" });
```
