It works on the basis that only one request from a given queue can be sent at a time and all previous requests are
immediately canceled. This way, we can be sure that only the last inquiry will be processed.

---

### Setup

```ts
export const getRandomDataSet = builder.createCommand()({
  endpoint: "/data",
  cancelable: true,
});
```

### Example

The example is written in typescript, but it also works in React hooks.

```ts
// Multiple commands being triggered
getRandomDataSet.send(); // will be canceled
getRandomDataSet.send(); // will be canceled
getRandomDataSet.send(); // will be canceled
getRandomDataSet.send();

// only last one will be processed
```
