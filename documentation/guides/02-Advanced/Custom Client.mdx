You can create your own client based on your preferences or requirements. You can use the bindings to achieve it. They
will let you to easily connect into the library logic flow, so this way you will make your custom client without
handling the internals on the library. We propose to use the `getClientBindings` util so you skip the sensitive and
highly advanced part of connecting into hyper fetch flow.

```tsx
const customHttpClient = async () => {
  const {
    fullUrl,
    method,
    headers,
    payload,
    config,
    getAbortController,
    getRequestStartTimestamp,
    getResponseStartTimestamp,
    createAbortListener,
    onBeforeRequest,
    onRequestStart,
    onRequestProgress,
    onRequestEnd,
    onResponseStart,
    onResponseProgress,
    onResponseEnd,
    onSuccess,
    onAbortError,
    onTimeoutError,
    onUnexpectedError,
    onError,
  } = await getClientBindings(command, requestId);

  // ... any custom client logic, you can see axios implementation bellow
  axios({
    method,
    url: fullUrl,
    data: payload,
    headers,
    timeout: config.timeout,
  });
};
```

Connect any client to communicate with the server and handle it as you want, the only thing that has to match is the
interface of the output.

```tsx
const customHttpClient: ClientType = (command: CommandInstance) => Promise.resolve([null, null, 0]);

const builder = new Builder({ baseUrl }).setClient(customHttpClient);
```

## Typescript

You can pass custom options to your client from global setup and while command initialization. To make sure we pass
correct configuration through this places we can specify the type for them. It is passed to the builder instance.

```tsx
type MyCustomClientOptions = {
  timeout?: number;
};

const builder = new Builder<Error, MyCustomClientOptions>({ baseUrl }).setClient(customHttpClient);
```
