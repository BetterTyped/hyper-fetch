In order to **`limit and optimize the number of queries to the backend`**, we can use the feature of `deduplication`. We
enable it by setting the `deduplicate: true` field on the command options. Thanks to this setting, **many requests made
at the same time will be optimized to one request**. We can refine the deduplication time with the deduplicateTime
option in the command options.

---

#### Setup

```ts
export const getUsers = builder.createCommand()({
  endpoint: "/users",
  deduplicate: true,
});
```

#### Example

The example is written in typescript, but it also works in React hooks.

```ts
// Multiple calls of the same command
getUsers.send();
getUsers.send();
getUsers.send();
getUsers.send();

// Only single request will be send to backend
```
