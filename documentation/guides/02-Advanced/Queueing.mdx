If we need to send requests in a specific order one by one, we can use the queue option. This option is especially
useful for sending or downloading large data.

---

#### Setup

```ts
export const postFile = builder.createCommand()({
  endpoint: "/files",
  queued: true,
});
```

#### Example

The example is written in typescript, but it also works in React hooks.

```ts
// Multiple files being send
postFile.send();
postFile.send();
postFile.send();
postFile.send();

// they will be send one by one awaiting for previous to be finished
```
