You can intercept responses or requests before they are handled by any other module. This way you can hook-in to
different available interceptors. They are added on a particular builder, you can chain-add them.

Interceptors can be deactivated on selected commands thanks to the options passed to them. To do this, use the
`disableRequestInterceptors` and `disableResponseInterceptors`.

## Request interceptors

You can add an interceptor to every command executed within a given builder and overwrite the sent data or execute your
own logic.

```ts
export const builder = new Builder({ baseUrl }).onRequest(async (response, command) => {
  // Add your custom logic

  return response;
});
```

## Response interceptors

With response interceptors, you can call your own logic and change the returned data before it is handled in the system.

### onSuccess

```ts
export const builder = new Builder({ baseUrl }).onSuccess(async (response, command) => {
  // Add your custom logic

  return response;
});
```

### onError

```ts
export const builder = new Builder({ baseUrl }).onError(async (response, command) => {
  // Add your custom logic

  return response;
});
```

### onResponse

```ts
export const builder = new Builder({ baseUrl }).onResponse(async (response, command) => {
  // Add your custom logic

  return response;
});
```
