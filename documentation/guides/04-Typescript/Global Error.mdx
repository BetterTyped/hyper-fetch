Usually, we can get a very specific type of error from the backend, so we can propagate its type between our commands.We
do it during the setup of our builder.

:::info

Remember to add the Error type, which is returned from internal errors like Canceled / Timeout / Unexpected Error.

### Example

```ts
type GlobalErrors = Error | { message: string };

export const builder = new Builder<GlobalErrors>({ baseUrl });
```
