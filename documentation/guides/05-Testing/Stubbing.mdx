You can easily create the stubs helpers for the test setup using the existing development environment.

### Stub helpers

Below is an example of use with the MSW library.

```ts
import { setupServer } from "msw/node";

export const server = setupServer();

const createStub = <Command extends CommandInstance>(command: Command, fixture?: ExtractResponse<T>) => {
  server.use(
    // Describe the requests to mock.
    rest.get(command.endpoint, (req, res, ctx) => {
      return res(ctx.json(fixture));
    }),
  );
};
```

### Stub tests

Then we can use the prepared util along with the commands prepared during development.

```ts
import { getBook } from "api/books";

beforeAll(() => {
  // Establish requests interception layer before all tests.
  server.listen();
});
afterAll(() => {
  // Clean up after all tests are done, preventing this
  // interception layer from affecting irrelevant tests.
  server.close();
});
test("renders a book details component", () => {
  const book = { bookId: 1, bookTitle: "Lord of the Rings" };
  createStub(getBook, book);

  // Render component, perform request, API communication is covered above.
  renderComponent();

  // Some assertions
});
```
