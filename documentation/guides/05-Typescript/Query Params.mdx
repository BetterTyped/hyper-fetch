Query Params are very often untyped, which may cause maintenance problems. However, this is not the case here, and our
query params types can be easily added to the command.

---

### Example

```ts
type QueryParamsType = {
  search?: string;
  role?: "Admin" | "User";
};

const getUsers = builder.createCommand<ResponseType, null, null, QueryParamsType>()({
  endpoint: "/users",
});
```
