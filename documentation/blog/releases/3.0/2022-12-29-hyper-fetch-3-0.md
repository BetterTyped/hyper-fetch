## Hyper Fetch 3.0 is out! 🎉🎉

It has been exactly **one year since the first version of Hyper Fetch** was presented, and two years since work on the
tool began. The initial scope, which was ambitious in its assumptions, has been extended. We are proud to announce that
today, Hyper Fetch supports `HTTP`, `GraphQL`, `WebSockets`, `Server-Sent Events`, `React Hooks`, `persistence`, and
`offline-first` functionality, among many other features.

> Let's take a look on the 3.0 highlights and sum up 2022 together and take a look at our achievements and plans for an
> even better 2023!

<!--truncate-->

While working on the library, we were able not only **to achieve all major milestones for this year**, but also to
implement next year's goal of `supporting websockets and server sent events!` Let's take a look at the current and
future changes.

## Highlights

Overview of the most important changes 3.0 (and some of 2.0 features worth mentioning)

✅ **New and polished API** - We decided to clean up the naming and make the library easier to use

✅ **Better bouncing** - More control over debounce and throttle

✅ **Improved Garbage Collector** - More control over garbage collecting

✅ **Server http adapter** - Default http adapter to work in environment without XHR

✅ **Sockets** - Added support for Websockets and Server Sent Events

✅ **Sockets Reconnecting** - Smart reconnecting of sockets

✅ **Sockets Heartbeat** - Built-in heartbeat functionality for sockets

🎊 **NEW DOCS** - Improved and redacted documentation (soon also guides part)

## The most important features of `2022`

Below you will find some of the most interesting changes from this year.

### Type safety 🔒

With so many great libraries that make amazing use of typescript, we sincerely hope
`we've contributed to the development of new and amazing approaches`. First of all, I mean automatic **generation of
parameter types from the endpoint string**. A seemingly trivial thing, but incredibly powerful and giving incredible
confidence when implementing new requests or making changes to existing ones.

### Queues ➡️ ➡️ ➡️

One of the most important elements of Hyper Fetch, **Dispatcher-driven queues**, played a huge role in achieving our
goals smoothly. This idea is based on a standard queuing system, but using them doesn't have to be like a typical queue
by handling items one by one. The most important element of the queues in our system is the **efficient grouping of sent
requests in isolated pipelines**, from which we have access to repeated requests and their groups for easy interactions.

### Persistence 💎

Seemingly a very typical thing, i.e. saving data to localstorage, indexedDb or other persisting storages, but when **we
raise the bar even higher**, we will face the challenge of **persisting entire REQUESTS**. We achieved this goal
partially, on platforms such as React Native, it should not be a problem there, but when we consider browsers and the
ability to open multiple windows and tabs,
`it will quickly become clear how wrong we were in thinking that the current approach would be enough`. So far, we have
the ability to store our requests in json and "recreate" them again, this alone gives a solid foundation for future
iterations over this feature. To fully achieve this, **we still need to ensure communication between browser tabs and
hopefully we will achieve this goal next year**!

### Sockets 🛰️

**_Websockets and Server Sent Events_** are a completely different approach to communication than traditional HTTP
requests. When we need to listen to events or emit them dynamically, the Hyper Fetch logic ceases to matter. We have
created a separate dedicated package that, with the strength of our architecture, should efficiently add the ability to
handle events in our systems, it is an early version of this package, but we are excited about further work on it!

### Events Architecture ✨

At first, `we were not sure about basing our logic on events`, but in the end **it turned out to be a hit**, because it
not only facilitated our access to data from various dispersed places in our system, but also **allowed us to implement
a full lifecycle observation of our requests and incredible control over them** -
**`we can stop, resume, delete and abort our requests`**! In addition, thanks to this,
`we do not have to use Providers in the React` implementation and wrap our application in them, quickly, cleanly and
efficiently, while maintaining full isolation!

## What's next?

⚙️ Persistence of Requests in browsers and a fully prepared description of the implementation

⚙️ Commands to help generate Hyper Fetch client schemas, code and types

⚙️ Hyper Fetch backend implementation with controllers layer

⚙️ Support for more and better features around queueing and feature requests from issues

⚙️ More and better guides and examples

⚙️ ...and few more surprises!

## See you in 2023! 🎉🎉

We have come this way and we are fully ready to show what we are capable of next year!

See you soon!
