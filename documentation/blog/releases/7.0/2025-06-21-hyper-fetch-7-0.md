# The most significant update in our history has been released!

Version 7.0 is not just an update; it's a complete reimagining of the developer experience. We've listened to your
feedback, rebuilt our core from the ground up, and created tools that will fundamentally change how you build and debug
data-driven applications. We've modernized the entire library to provide a more robust and flexible data-fetching
solution.

:::info What is Hyper Fetch?

**Hyper Fetch** is a data-fetching framework meticulously crafted for simplicity and efficiency. Its type-safe design
and user-friendly interface ensure a seamless integration experience, whether you're working on the browser or the
server. Next-generation features streamline architecture creation, grant access to the request lifecycle, and empower
rapid development of new components and functionalities, all while facilitating real-time data exchange.

## Highlights

An overview of the most important changes in Hyper Fetch 7.0.

### Hyper Flow: The New DevTools

We are thrilled to introduce **Hyper Flow**, a brand-new, standalone Electron application that provides a powerful and
intuitive UI for debugging and visualizing your Hyper-Fetch requests. It gives you a crystal-clear window into your
application's state in real-time.

- **Real-time Monitoring**: See all your requests, cache, and queue states as they happen.
- **Detailed Inspection**: Dive deep into individual requests to see their data, headers, and timings.
- **Easy Management**: Inspect and manage your cached data and request queues directly from the UI.
- **Data Visualization**: Visualize your data flows and understand how your app interacts with your APIs.

### A Powerful Plugin System

The core of Hyper-Fetch is now extensible via a powerful new plugin system. This allows you and the community to build
new functionality on top of the library. The first official plugin is `@hyper-fetch/plugin-devtools`, which seamlessly
connects your application to the new Hyper Flow DevTools.

### ESLint Plugin for Best Practices

To help you write better, more consistent code, we're releasing `@hyper-fetch/eslint-plugin-hyper-fetch`. This ESLint
plugin helps enforce best practices and avoid common pitfalls by catching potential issues before they become bugs.

### A Robust Testing Module

Testing data-fetching logic has always been a challenge. The new `@hyper-fetch/testing` module is here to solve that. It
provides out-of-the-box mocking for everything you need, making your tests easier to write and more reliable:

- HTTP requests
- GraphQL queries and mutations
- Server-Sent Events (SSE)
- WebSockets

## Breaking Changes

This release introduces several breaking changes. Please review them carefully before upgrading.

### Core (`@hyper-fetch/core`)

#### Simplified Client and Request Creation

The `new Client()` constructor is now deprecated. Use the new `createClient()` function instead. The
`client.createRequest()` method also features an improved and more fluent API for building your requests.

**Old:**

```ts
import { Client } from "@hyper-fetch/core";

const client = new Client({
  url: "https://api.example.com",
});
```

**New:**

```ts
import { createClient } from "@hyper-fetch/core";

export const client = createClient({
  url: "https://api.example.com",
});
```

### React (`@hyper-fetch/react`)

#### Provider Renamed

For clarity and better discoverability, `ConfigProvider` has been renamed to `HyperFetchProvider`.

### Sockets (`@hyper-fetch/sockets`)

The socket implementation has been completely rewritten. We now provide two separate, more focused adapters for
Server-Sent Events (`@hyper-fetch/socket-adapter-sse`) and WebSockets (`@hyper-fetch/socket-adapter-ws`).

## Other Changes

- **TypeScript Strict Mode**: The library now fully supports TypeScript's `strict` mode. This may cause type errors in
  your existing codebase but will result in more robust applications.
- **Immer Integration**: We now use Immer for immutable state management. This is a significant internal update for more
  predictable state and should be a transparent change for most users.
- **Improved Caching**: We've introduced `cacheTime` and `staleTime` options for more granular control over caching,
  similar to what you might find in other popular data-fetching libraries.
- **ESM-only**: To align with the broader JavaScript ecosystem, HyperFetch is now an ESM-only library. You will need to
  ensure your build system can handle ESM packages.
- **Default HTTP Adapter**: The default HTTP adapter is now included in `@hyper-fetch/core`. You no longer need to
  install a separate adapter for basic HTTP requests.
- **Updated Adapters**: All adapters (`axios`, `firebase`, `firebase-admin`, `graphql`) have been updated to be
  compatible with the new core changes.

## Special Thanks

We would like to thank our wonderful community for participating in this journey. This release was a massive
undertaking, and we couldn't have done it without your support. Thank you for your feedback, contributions, and for
being part of the Hyper-Fetch family.

## What's Next?

This release builds a new foundation for Hyper-Fetch. The modernization of the core, the new plugin system, and the
focus on developer experience with tools like Hyper Flow open up a world of possibilities. We are excited to continue
building on this foundation to bring you even more powerful features in the future.

Thank you for all the support. We can't wait to see what you build with Hyper-Fetch 7.0!
