# HyperFetch v7.0.0 Release Notes

This is a major release that brings a completely revamped developer experience, a new plugin system, and a host of other
improvements and breaking changes. The entire library has been modernized to provide a more robust and flexible
data-fetching solution.

---

## âœ¨ Highlights

### ðŸš€ Hyper Flow: The New DevTools

We are thrilled to introduce **Hyper Flow**, a brand-new, standalone Electron application that provides a powerful and
intuitive UI for debugging and visualizing your HyperFetch requests.

<!--truncate-->

- **Real-time Monitoring**: See all your requests, cache, and queue state in real-time.
- **Detailed Request Inspection**: Dive deep into individual requests to see their data, headers, and timings.
- **Cache and Queue Management**: Inspect and manage your cached data and request queues.
- **Data Visualization**: Visualize your data flows and understand how your app interacts with your APIs.
- **And much more...**

### ðŸ”Œ New Plugin System

HyperFetch now has a powerful plugin system that allows you to extend its functionality. The first official plugin is
`@hyper-fetch/plugin-devtools`, which connects your application to the new Hyper Flow DevTools.

### ESLint Plugin

A new ESLint plugin (`@hyper-fetch/eslint-plugin-hyper-fetch`) is now available to help you enforce best practices and
avoid common pitfalls when using HyperFetch.

### ðŸ§ª Testing Module

The new `@hyper-fetch/testing` module makes it easier than ever to test your data-fetching logic. It provides
out-of-the-box mocking for:

- HTTP requests
- GraphQL queries and mutations
- Server-Sent Events (SSE)
- WebSockets

## ðŸ’¥ Breaking Changes

This release introduces several breaking changes. Please review them carefully before upgrading.

### Core (`@hyper-fetch/core`)

- **Client and Request Creation**:
  - The `new Client()` constructor is deprecated. Use the new `createClient()` function instead.
  - Use the new `client.createRequest()` method to build your requests. This new method provides improved type inference
    and a more fluent API.
- **TypeScript Strict Mode**: The library now fully supports TypeScript's `strict` mode. This may cause type errors in
  your existing codebase if you are not using strict mode.
- **Immer Integration**: We now use Immer for immutable state management. This should be a transparent change for most
  users, but it's a significant internal update.
- **Cache and Dispatcher**: The caching and request dispatching systems have been heavily refactored for better
  performance and reliability.
- **`cacheTime` and `staleTime`**: We've introduced `cacheTime` and `staleTime` options for more granular control over
  caching, similar to what you might know from other data-fetching libraries.
- **Default HTTP Adapter**: The default HTTP adapter is now included in the `@hyper-fetch/core` package. You no longer
  need to install a separate adapter for basic HTTP requests.

### React (`@hyper-fetch/react`)

- **Hooks API**: The React hooks (`useFetch`, `useSubmit`, etc.) have been refactored. While the core functionality
  remains the same, there might be subtle changes in behavior and return values.
- **Hydration**: We've introduced new and improved APIs for server-side rendering (SSR) hydration.
- **`Provider`**: The `ConfigProvider` has been renamed to `HyperFetchProvider` for clarity.

### Sockets (`@hyper-fetch/sockets`)

- **Adapters**: The socket implementation has been completely rewritten. We now provide two separate adapters:
  - `@hyper-fetch/socket-adapter-sse` for Server-Sent Events.
  - `@hyper-fetch/socket-adapter-ws` for WebSockets.
- **Improved Error Handling**: Error handling for socket connections has been significantly improved.

### Adapters (`@hyper-fetch/adapter-*`)

- All adapters (`axios`, `firebase`, `firebase-admin`, `graphql`) have been updated to be compatible with the new core
  changes. You will need to update them to their latest versions.

### Build System

- We have dropped support for CommonJS (CJS). HyperFetch is now an ESM-only library. You will need to ensure your build
  system is configured to handle ESM packages.

## ðŸ“¦ New Packages

- `@hyper-fetch/hyper-flow`: The new DevTools application.
- `@hyper-fetch/plugin-devtools`: The plugin to connect your app to Hyper Flow.
- `@hyper-fetch/eslint-plugin-hyper-fetch`: The new ESLint plugin.
- `@hyper-fetch/testing`: The new testing module.

---

## Upgrading

To upgrade to v6.0.0, you will need to update all the HyperFetch packages you are using to their latest versions.

```bash
npm install @hyper-fetch/core@latest @hyper-fetch/react@latest ...
# or
yarn add @hyper-fetch/core@latest @hyper-fetch/react@latest ...
```

We recommend carefully reviewing the updated documentation and examples to understand how to adapt your code to the new
APIs.
