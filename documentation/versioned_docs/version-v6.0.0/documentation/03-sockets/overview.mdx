Sockets module was created to handle listeners and emitters on open connections. Our base `Hyper Fetch` package was
created with different approach to things like interceptors or data exchange itself but has some architecture decisions
in common, like singleton pattern.

## Main Goals ðŸ”®

âœ… Neutral standard for data exchange

âœ… Architecture to support composing our logic with existing clients like socket.io, firebase, etc.

âœ… Possibility to attach own adapters with ease and type safety

âœ… Separation of listeners and emitters to clearly split responsibility

âœ… SSE and Websocket by default

## Simple examples

Here you can find some simple examples of how to use our sockets module.

#### Initialize Client

```tsx
import { Socket } from "./socket";

export const socket = new Sockets({
  url: "ws://localhost:3000",
});
```

#### Create Listeners

```ts
import { socket } from "./socket";

export const onChatMessage = socket.createListener<ChatMessageType>()({
  endpoint: "chat-message", // endpoint of the event
});

onChatMessage.listen({ callback: (data) => console.log(data) });
```

#### Create Emitters

```tsx
import { socket } from "./socket";

export const sendChatMessage = socket.createEmitter<ChatMessageType, AcknowledgementResponseType>()({
  endpoint: "chat-message", // endpoint of the event
});

sendChatMessage.emit({ data: { message: "Hello world" } });
```

## Congratulations! You're ready to use **Hyper Fetch Sockets**! ðŸŽŠ
