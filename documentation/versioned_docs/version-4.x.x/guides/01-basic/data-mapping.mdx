# Data Mapping

### Changing data before sending it to server

We often encounter the need to `map` data before sending data to server. This is usually required for two reasons.

One of them is `breaking changes to the server api`, which may require many updates to our existing code, which may be
dangerous for the application and introduce **regression**.

Another case is sending `FormData`, which is impossible to represent in the form of an exact interface in terms of the
fields it contains. In order not to send something that is equivalent to the type `any`, we can specify the correct type
in the request and then map everything to FormData just before it gets added to
**[Dispatcher](/documentation/02-core/dispatcher.mdx)**.

This way, we ensure very `type-safe` and `flexible` development of our application.

### Set payload data mapper

Below example show the implementation for FormData

```ts
export const postUserProfile = client
  .createRequest<boolean, UserProfile>()({
    method: "PATCH",
    endpoint: "/users/profile/:userId",
  })
  .setDataMapper((data) => {
    // Transform data:UserProfile into FormData
    const formData = new FormData();

    Object.entries(data).forEach(([key, value]) => {
      formData.append(key, value);
    });

    // Return new data format
    return formData;
  });
```

### Map whole request

Below example show the implementation of request mapping. We can make each `postUserProfile` request to add custom
headers or any other value to the request before sending it later on when we use it in our application. This way we can
implement mappers, validators and any async logic. Throwing an error makes request to return error just like we get it
from the "real" query.

```ts
export const postUserProfile = client
  .createRequest<boolean, UserProfile>()({
    method: "PATCH",
    endpoint: "/users/profile/:userId",
  })
  .setRequestMapper((request) => {
    return request.setHeaders({ ...request.headers, "X-Better-Typed": "My custom header" });
  });
```
