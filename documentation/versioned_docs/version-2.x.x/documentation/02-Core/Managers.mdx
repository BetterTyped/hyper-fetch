The library contains several managers, they are mainly used to support smaller subsystems and features.

## AppManager

<br />

This class is responsible for the application’s `online` or `offline` state and whether the application window is
`focused` or `blurred`.

For example, suppose you want to use Hyper Fetch in a React Native environment and the default web browser events won't
work. In that case, you need to set the events that are most optimal for the current environment.

:::info

Hyper Fetch event listeners return unmounting callbacks for easier cleanup handling.

:::

```tsx
const unmountFocusListener = builder.commandManager.events.onFocus(console.log);
const unmountOfflineListener = builder.commandManager.events.onOffline(console.log);

...

unmountFocusListener()
unmountOfflineListener()
```

### Events

{@import Hyper-Fetch getAppManagerEvents returns}

## CommandManager

<br />

The `CommandManager` is responsible for holding the cancellation tokens needed to terminate the requests and for the
events related to the requests lifecycle - request `start`, `upload`, `download`, `response` and `abort`.

The `CommandManager` holds the cancellation tokens needed to terminate requests. It also manages tokens for events
related to the request lifecycle, i.e. request `start`, `upload`, `download`, `response`, and `abort`.

:::info

Hyper Fetch event listeners return unmounting callbacks for easier cleanup handling.

:::

```tsx

const unmountUploadListener = builder.commandManager.events.onUploadProgressById(requestId, console.log);
const unmountDownloadListener = builder.commandManager.events.onDownloadProgressById(requestId, console.log);

...

unmountUploadListener()
unmountDownloadListener()
```

### AbortKey

Every request added to the dispatcher creates an abort controller for itself. This controller is stored in the Map
object under abort key with the `requestId`. This lets you abort whole groups of requests using `abortKey` or single
requests using their `requestId`. By default, `abortKey` is automatically created on command out of its endpoint and
method, but you can set custom values.

### Events

{@import Hyper-Fetch getCommandManagerEvents returns}

```ts
builder.commandManager.events.onResponse((response, details) => {
  // ...
});
```

## LoggerManager

<div class="api-link">
  <div class="api-link-title">LoggerManager</div>
  <div class="api-link-sub-title">

  </div>
</div>

<br />

LoggerManager is the main instance of the Hyper Fetch logging system. You can initiate single loggers based on it in
subsystems; this allows you to isolate these loggers but still give them access to the parent configuration in the
Builder.

```ts
const logger = builder.loggerManager.init("My Module")

logger.error(...) // output in console => [My Module] Some message
```
