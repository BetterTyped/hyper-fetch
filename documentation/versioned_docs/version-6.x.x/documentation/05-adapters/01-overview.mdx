## About

Adapter is a package wrapping another existing package or framework, enhancing it with all the HF features, and
enhancing HF with all the possibilities of the adapted package. Writing an adapter is easy as HF allows for easy extension of `BaseAdapterType` and
our prepared set of methods called *adapter bindings*.
