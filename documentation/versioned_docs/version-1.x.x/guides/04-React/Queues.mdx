Queues allow us to relieve the system and run in the background. So that, for example, when a user sends large files to
the server, he can use the rest of the application at the same time. What's more, it can stop and resume the shipment,
view the sending status of individual requests, along with the remaining time, size and progress.

### Example

```tsx
const { submit } = useSubmit(postFile.setData(formData));
const { stopped, requests, stop, start } = useQueue(postFile);

return (
  <div>
    <Button onClick={() => resultQueued.submit()}>Send File</Button>
    {requests.map((request) => (
      <Request request={request} /> // Component to inspect the requests upload progress and stop/start functionality
    ))}
  </div>
);
```
