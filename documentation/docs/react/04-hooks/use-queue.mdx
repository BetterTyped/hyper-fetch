# useQueue

This hook controls the **dispatcher queues**. It uses the [`Dispatcher`](/core/dispatcher.mdx) to read the actual value
of the queue, which is based on the `queryKey` retrieved from the request passed as the first argument.

A prepared [`Request`](/core/request.mdx) is the minimum requirement for `useQueue`.

[Read the API Reference Â»](/api/react/Hooks/useQueue.mdx)

---

:::tip Purpose

1. **Queue control for requests**: Manage and observe the queue of requests for a given `Request` instance.
2. **Fine-grained request lifecycle**: Start, stop, and pause entire queues or individual requests.
3. **Real-time updates**: Reactively track the state of all requests in the queue.
4. **Integration with Dispatcher**: Leverages the [`Dispatcher`](/docs/core/dispatcher) for queue management and event
   updates.
5. **Advanced queue strategies**: Works best with `one-by-one` dispatching and the `queued` option enabled.

## Quick Start

To use `useQueue`, provide a prepared [`Request`](/docs/core/request) instance. The hook returns the current queue state
and control methods.

```tsx title="Controlling a request queue" size=md
import { useQueue } from "@hyper-fetch/react";
import { getUsers } from "./api/users";

function App() {
  // highlight-start
  const { requests } = useQueue(getUsers);
  // highlight-end

  return (
    <div>
      <ul>
        // highlight-start
        {/* List of currently running requests */}
        {requests.map((req) => (
          <li key={req.requestId}>{req.requestOptions.endpoint}</li>
        ))}
        // highlight-end
      </ul>
    </div>
  );
}
```

## How it works

**`useQueue`** uses the request's `queryKey` to read and control the Dispatcher queue. It subscribes to Dispatcher
events to keep the queue state up to date. This hook is ideal for advanced scenarios where you need to:

- Control the execution order of requests
- Pause, stop, or resume queued requests
- Monitor the status of all requests in a queue
- Integrate with custom queueing strategies

It works best with the `one-by-one` dispatching mode and when the `queued` option is set to `true` on the request.

:::caution

Remember to ensure your request's `queryKey` is static when using this hook. If your request uses dynamic params or
query params, auto-generated keys may cause incorrect queue tracking. Provide a custom `queryKey` when creating the
request to avoid this issue.

## Controlling the Queue

The hook returns methods to control the queue and individual requests:

```tsx
const { requests, stopped, stop, start, pause } = useQueue(getUsers);

// Control all requests in the queue
top(); // Stops the queue
pause(); // Pauses the queue
start(); // Starts the queue

// Control individual requests
requests.forEach((req) => {
  req.stopRequest();
  req.startRequest();
});
```

Read more about the differences between `stop`, `pause`, and `start` in the [`Dispatcher`](/docs/core/dispatcher)
documentation.

## Options

Customize the behavior of `useQueue` by passing an options object as the second argument.

```tsx
const { ... } = useQueue(request, options);

`useQueue` returns an object with the current queue state, control methods, and request helpers.

```tsx
const values = useQueue(request);
```
