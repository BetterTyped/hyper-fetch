The library contains several managers, they are mainly used to support smaller subsystems and features.

---

## AppManager

<a class="api-link" href="/api/Hyper-Fetch/Class/AppManager">
  <div class="api-link-title">AppManager</div>
  <div class="api-link-sub-title">Read the API Reference »</div>
</a>

<br />

This class is responsible for the state of our application in terms of `online` or `offline` status and whether the
application window is `focused` or `blured`.

For example, if we want to use hyper-fetch in a `react native environment`, our default web browser events won't work,
we need to set the ones that are most optimal for the current environment.

:::info

Events listeners in the Hyper Fetch returns the unmounting callback for easier cleanup handling.

:::

```tsx
const unmountFocusListener = builder.commandManager.events.onFocus(console.log);
const unmountOfflineListener = builder.commandManager.events.onOffline(console.log);

...

unmountFocusListener()
unmountOfflineListener()
```

### Events

{@import Hyper-Fetch getAppManagerEvents returns}

---

## CommandManager

<a class="api-link" href="/api/Hyper-Fetch/Class/CommandManager">
  <div class="api-link-title">CommandManager</div>
  <div class="api-link-sub-title">Read the API Reference »</div>
</a>

<br />

The `CommandManager` is responsible for holding the cancelation tokens needed to terminate the requests and for the
events related to the requests lifecycle - request `start`, `upload`, `download`, `response` and `abort`.

:::info

Events listeners in the Hyper Fetch returns the unmounting callback for easier cleanup handling.

:::

```tsx

const unmountUploadListener = builder.commandManager.events.onUploadProgressById(requestId, console.log);
const unmountDownloadListener = builder.commandManager.events.onDownloadProgressById(requestId, console.log);

...

unmountUploadListener()
unmountDownloadListener()
```

### AbortKey

Every requests which gets added to the dispatcher creates the abort controller for itself that's placed in Map object
and it's stored there under abort key and requestId in it. This way we can abort whole groups of requests by abortKey or
single requests by their requestId. By default it is automatically created on command out of it's endpoint and method,
but we an set the custom value for easier usage.

### Events

{@import Hyper-Fetch getCommandManagerEvents returns}

```ts
builder.commandManager.events.onResponse((response, details) => {
  // ...
});
```

## LoggerManager

<a class="api-link" href="/api/Hyper-Fetch/Class/LoggerManager">
  <div class="api-link-title">LoggerManager</div>
  <div class="api-link-sub-title">Read the API Reference »</div>
</a>

<br />

LoggerManager is the main instance of the logging system in hyper-fetch. On its basis, we initiate single loggers in
subsystems that are used in isolation, but still have access to the parent configuration in the builder.

```ts
const logger = builder.loggerManager.init("My Module")

logger.error(...) // output in console => [My Module] Some message
```
