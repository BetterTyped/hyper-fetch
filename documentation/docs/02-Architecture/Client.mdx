## Introduction

**`Client`** is a function that is responsible for communication with the server. The default client is used to
communicate with the REST server. However, there is nothing to prevent us from changing and creating the client we need.
Thanks to event communication, we can set our own client as we wish.

By default, the client is responsible for requests, but its role is very significant for many other elements - such as
tracking the progress of requests, listening for cancelation, mapping payload and headers. It also applies all the
interceptors in requesting lifecycle.

:::caution

If there is no XHR in the window object or the XHR object is a polyfill in your environment, you have to install a npm
package [xmlhttprequest](https://www.npmjs.com/package/xmlhttprequest) and set it on the window object.

## Purpose

- `Requests` handler of the builder dispatchers
- `Changeability` of the handler to provide more flexibility

## Custom Client

You can create your own client based on your preferences or requirements. You can use the bindings to achieve it. They
will let you to easily connect into the library logic flow, so this way you will make your custom client without
handling the internals on the library. We propose to use the `getClientBindings` util so you skip the sensitive and
highly advanced part of connecting into hyper fetch flow.

```tsx
const customHttpClient = async () => {
  const {
    fullUrl,
    headers,
    payload,
    config,
    getAbortController,
    getRequestStartTimestamp,
    getResponseStartTimestamp,
    createAbortListener,
    onBeforeRequest,
    onRequestStart,
    onRequestProgress,
    onRequestEnd,
    onResponseStart,
    onResponseProgress,
    onResponseEnd,
    onSuccess,
    onAbortError,
    onTimeoutError,
    onUnexpectedError,
    onError,
  } = await getClientBindings(command, requestId);

  // ... custom client logic
};
```

Connect any client to communicate with the server and handle it as you want, the only thing that has to match is the
interface of the output.

```tsx
const customHttpClient: ClientType = (command: CommandInstance) => Promise.resolve([null, null, 0]);

const builder = new Builder({ baseUrl }).setClient(customHttpClient);
```
