## Introduction

**`Command`** is a class that creates a template for request and all necessary information needed for it to be made.
It's strength lays in it's strict and predictable data structure. Thanks to which we can dump it, save it to some
storage as a json and recreate it later from it. This approach allows you to develop a full persistence flow - we can
easily persist command dumps between sessions.

The command contains mass about its behavior in the queues or cache, data on the server, and information necessary to
execute a valid request. In combination with typescript we get a very friendly flow, resistant to mistakes.

We can trigger the request with the `send` method, which add request to the queue and returns the response.

---

## Purpose

- `Configuration` of requests templates
- `Standardization` of the data schema in system
- `Sending` requests by using dispatchers

---

## Initialization

The command should be initialized from the builder instance, this way we pass a shared reference to the place that
manages communication in the application.

:::caution

We are using currying in `createCommand` method to achieve auto generated types for the endpoint string. This solution
will be removed once
[https://github.com/microsoft/TypeScript/issues/10571](https://github.com/microsoft/TypeScript/issues/10571) get
resolved.

:::

```tsx
import { builder } from "./builder";

export const getUsers = builder.createCommand<UserModel[]>()({
  method: "GET",
  endpoint: "/users",
});

export const getUser = builder.createCommand<UserModel>()({
  method: "GET",
  endpoint: "/users/:userId",
});

export const postUser = builder.createCommand<UserModel, UserPostDataType>()({
  method: "POST",
  endpoint: "/users",
});

export const patchUser = builder.createCommand<UserModel, Partial<UserPostDataType>>()({
  method: "PATCH",
  endpoint: "/users/:userId",
});

export const deleteUser = builder.createCommand<null>()({
  method: "DELETE",
  endpoint: "/users/:userId",
});
```

## Request building

### Initialize

The process begins with command initialization. At this point, we have the option of an extensive configuration of how
our request will behave, but most of it is optional. It is also possible to prepare a global configuration in the
builder and avoid copying the setup between commands.

```tsx
const postUser = builder.createCommand<null>()({
  endpoint: "/some-endpoint",
  headers: {},
  auth: true,
  method: "POST"
  cancelable: false,
  retry: 2,
  retryTime: 1000,
  cache: false,
  cacheTime: 50000
  queued: false,
  deduplicate: false,
  offline: false,
  options: {}, // Client options
  disableRequestInterceptors: false,
  disableResponseInterceptors: false,
});
```

### Request Data

You can set any data to be sent to the server by using the `setData` method.

```tsx
// Regular data
postUser.setData({ name: "John", age: 18 })

// Form data
const data = new FormData();
...
postFile.setData(data)
```

### Parameters

Parameters has to be defined in the endpoint of the command by stating it with `:`.

```tsx
const getNote = builder.createCommand()({
  endpoint: "/note/:noteId";
})
const getCategory = builder.createCommand()({
  endpoint: "/category/:categoryId";
})
const getCategoryNote = builder.createCommand()({
  endpoint: "/category/:noteId";
})
```

When we have properly prepared commands that expect parameters, we can add them using the `setParams` method.
Additionally by generic typescript, these parameters will match the endpoint ones by using literal types and require
them.

```tsx
getNote.setParams({ noteId: 1 });
getCategory.setParams({ categoryId: 2 });
getCategoryNote.setParams({ categoryId: 2, noteId: 1 });
```

### Query parameters

You can set query params by using the `setQueryParams` method. With typescript you can set it up to be accepted as
strings, objects or strict interface. The encoding type for arrays and other options is possible to be setup on the
builder. You can also provide your own encoding logic.

```tsx
getUsers.setQueryParams({ search: "John", sort: "age" });
```

### Trigger request

You can perform a request with the `send` method.

```tsx
// Simple Send
getNotes.send();

// Chained Send
getUsers.setQueryParams({ search: "John", sort: "age" }).send();

// Multiple chained Send
getCategory.setParams({ categoryId: 2 }).setQueryParams({ sortNotes: "age" }).send();
```

## Methods

Using methods on a command is different from the other classes in Hyper Fetch. This is to ensure isolation between
different uses - not to overwrite previously prepared commands with each other and to dynamically generate keys for
queues or cache.

:::danger

Using any method on command returns its clone! `We don't return a reference!`

:::

```tsx
// ❌ WRONG

const command = getUser;

command.setParams({ userId: 1 }); // Returns CLONED command with assigned params

command.send(); // Server error - no params
```

```tsx
// ✅ Good

const command = getUser;

const commandWithParams = command.setParams({ userId: 1 }); // Returns CLONED command with assigned params

commandWithParams.send(); // Success
```

---

## Keys

Each command gets its identifiers - `queueKey`, `cacheKey`, `abortKey` and `effectKey`. They are needed to determine
under which key items will be cached, queued, canceled or handled by [Effects](/docs/Architecture/Effect). By default
keys are auto-generated based on the current values of parameters, endpoint, method, but you can overwrite those values
with the proper method.

---

## Typescript

Builder has four generic types built in. This includes `Response`, `Payload`, `Local Error Response`, `Query Params`.

```tsx
type Response = { name: string }; // What's returned from request
type Payload = { email: string }; // What's send with request
type LocalError = { nameMessage: string }; // Additional "local" errors like errors for particular form
type QueryParams = { sort: string; search: string }; // Query params interface

const someCommand = builder.createCommand<Response, Payload, LocalError, QueryParams>()({
  endpoint: "category/:categoryId",
});

someCommand.setData(); // Require the 'Payload' type
someCommand.setParams(); // Require { categoryId: Param } type
someCommand.setQueryParams(); // Require the 'QueryParams' type

const [data, error] = someCommand.send();

data; // Has 'Response' type
error; // Has 'GlobalError' or 'LocalError' type
```

## Parameters
