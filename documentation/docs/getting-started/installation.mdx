An installation of Hyper Fetch can be run `clean` or for a specific environment. However, we only currently support
React.

:::info

The main `@hyper-fetch/core` package is required for other sub packages to work.

## Install Core packages

For minimal installation, you need to install the core package and eslint plugin.

```bash npm2yarn2pnpm
npm install --save @hyper-fetch/core eslint-plugin-hyper-fetch
```

:::warning

[Eslint plugin](../integrations/plugin-eslint/) is required for maximum type safety. It enhances the abilities of the
typescript via checking the object generic types to match exact schema.

## Sockets

Sockets is created for handling websockets or server sent events.

```bash npm2yarn2pnpm
npm install --save @hyper-fetch/sockets
```

## React

React allows the installation of the base library with hooks, offering interfaces that facilitate library usage and
support the application lifecycle.

```bash npm2yarn2pnpm
bun add @hyper-fetch/core @hyper-fetch/react
```
