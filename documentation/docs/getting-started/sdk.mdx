# Building SDKs with Hyper Fetch

> Hyper Fetch is not just a data-fetching library; it's a powerful framework for creating robust, type-safe, and highly
> customizable Software Development Kits (SDKs). Whether you're building a client for your own API or for a third-party
> service, Hyper Fetch provides the tools you need to create a great developer experience.

## The Power of a Well-Defined SDK

An SDK abstracts away the complexities of interacting with an API. Instead of making raw HTTP calls, developers can use
a set of pre-defined, type-safe methods that are easy to discover and use. This reduces boilerplate, prevents common
errors, and speeds up development time.

### Key Features for SDK Development

#### Unmatched Type Safety

Hyper Fetch's `createRequest` builder is the cornerstone of its type safety. By defining types for responses, payloads,
and even query parameters, you can catch errors at compile time, not runtime.

```typescript
// api/requests/users.ts
import { client } from "../client";

//highlight-start
export const getUser = client.createRequest<{ response: { id: string; name: string } }>()({
  endpoint: "/users/:userId",
  method: "GET",
});
//highlight-end
```

Now, anyone using `getUser` will get full type support for the response data.

#### Seamless Testability

Because requests are just classes, they can be easily mocked in your tests. You don't need complex mocking libraries or
to spin up a server. You can use our official testing library to make it even easier.

Check out our [Testing Guide](mdc:/docs/guides/testing/overview.mdx).

#### Endless Customization

The `Client` instance is the heart of your SDK. It's a builder that you can use to configure every aspect of your SDK's
behavior.

- **Adapters**: Swap out the default fetch adapter for `axios`, `graphql`, or even your own custom adapter.
- **Cache**: Configure global caching strategies and allow them to be overridden on a per-request basis.
- **Queueing**: Add offline support and request queueing for unreliable network conditions.

```typescript
// api/client.ts
import { createClient } from "@hyper-fetch/core";

//highlight-start
export const apiClient = createClient({
  url: "https://my-api.com",
});
//highlight-end
```

## Creating Your First SDK

Let's walk through creating a simple SDK for a hypothetical "todos" API.

1.  **Setup the Client**

First, we create a configured `Client` instance. This will be the entry point for our SDK.

```typescript title="api/client.ts"
import { createClient } from "@hyper-fetch/core";

export const todosApi = createClient({
  url: "https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com",
});
```

2.  **Define Requests**

Next, we define the requests for our API endpoints.

```typescript title="api/todos.requests.ts"
import { todosApi } from "./client";

// Define the type for a single todo item
interface Todo {
  userId: number;
  id: number;
  title: string;
  completed: boolean;
}

export const getTodos = todosApi.createRequest<Todo[]>()({
  endpoint: "/todos",
  method: "GET",
});

export const getTodo = todosApi.createRequest<Todo>()({
  endpoint: "/todos/:todoId",
  method: "GET",
});
```

3.  **Bundle and Export**

Finally, we bundle our client and requests into a single entry point for our SDK.

```typescript title="api/index.ts"
import { todosApi } from "./client";
import * as todos from "./todos.requests";

export const MySDK = {
  client: todosApi,
  todos,
};
```

4.  **Using the SDK**

Now, in any application, we can use our SDK with full type safety.

```tsx title="app/components/todos-list.tsx"
import { useFetch } from "@hyper-fetch/react";
import { MySDK } from "../api";

function TodosList() {
  const { data, loading } = useFetch(MySDK.todos.getTodos);

  if (loading) {
    return <div>Loading...</div>;
  }

  return <ul>{data?.map((todo) => <li key={todo.id}>{todo.title}</li>)}</ul>;
}
```

This is a simple example, but it demonstrates how easy it is to create a clean, maintainable, and type-safe SDK with
Hyper Fetch.

:::secondary Summary

You've learned how Hyper Fetch is an excellent choice for building SDKs. By leveraging its core features, you can
create:

- **Type-safe** APIs that reduce bugs.
- **Testable** code that is easy to verify.
- **Customizable** clients that can adapt to any need.
- **Reusable** and **shareable** packages that accelerate development.
