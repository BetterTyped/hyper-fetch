# Development

To help you get started with Hyper Fetch, we've outlined a few best practices for structuring your project. These are
suggestions, feel free to adapt them to your workflow.

---

## 1. Project Structure

1. **Organize by Feature:** Start by creating an `/api` directory to house your **client** and related **requests**.

2. **Entity-Based Directories:** For each entity in your system (e.g., users, todos, categories, products, groups),
   create a separate directory within `/api` to store the corresponding requests.

3. **Maximize Reusability:** By leveraging classes and an object-oriented approach, you can easily access and reuse
   requests throughout your application. This structure also allows your tests to utilize existing configurations
   without duplication.

**Example Structure:**

```
src
│
├── api
│   ├── client.ts
│   ├── users
│   │   └── users.api.ts
│   ├── products
│   │   └── products.api.ts
│   └── ...
├── ...
└── ...
```

## 2. Debugging

Preferred to debug is by using [Hyper Flow](/docs/hyper-flow) - dedicated devtools for Hyper Fetch. It allows you to see
all the requests, responses, and errors in one place - manage cache and see detailed statistics.

### Alternatively you can debug apps in one of two ways:

1. **Use the built-in logger**

Use the client `setDebug(true)` method for this. It will start logging actions in the console. To adjust what type of
logs will be shown, use `setLogLevel(3)` to get debug logs displayed in the console. Those will show you the exact data
and information flow in the library while working on your application.

2. **Create your own logger**

You can create your own dev tools based on events sent from the [requestManager](/core/managers.mdx#requestmanager).
There is no limitation, and you can receive all necessary data to create everything you may need.
