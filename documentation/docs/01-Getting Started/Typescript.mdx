Hyper Fetch was created with proper coverage of types in mind. Type safety with guards has been our goal from the very
beginning, as we wanted to create type safe tool that will help to identify the problems before they occur. We have used
many interesting solutions that allow us, among others, extract parameters from literal types and generate proper guards
for them, also inheritable generics that spread across your app as the ultimate source of truth for your setup and
environment.
