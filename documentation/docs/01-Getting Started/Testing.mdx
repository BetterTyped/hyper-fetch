## Introduction

Testing is one of the best things Hyper Fetch has to offer. With our architecture approach and focus on global singleton
structure, our tests can be largely based on the configuration we prepare for our application. Thanks to this, the tests
are no longer sensitive to micro changes (like changing endpoints or types). Everything here reacts and adapts to our
tests or shows the appropriate error - they are easier to maintain and faster to write.

## Benefits

- Our setup is always up to date with the production solution
- No duplication of the configurations and setups
- Easy maintenance of the tests
- Tests are faster to build

## Example

In our approach we are using great mocking library [msw](https://mswjs.io/) and
[testin-library](https://testing-library.com/) but this solution works with other libraries like
[Cypress](https://www.cypress.io/). Thanks to it we can simulate the real requests and make our tests as close to
production environment as we can. Together we can create really powerfull flow that allow us to create tests with ease
and fun.

You can create the utilities set that takes command and use its method, endpoint and types to create function that allow
you to intercept request.

```tsx
import { getUsers } from "commands";

const getUsersInterceptor = createInterceptor(getUsers, {
  data: [
    { name: "John", age: 18 },
    { name: "Matthew", age: 27 },
  ],
});

it("My test", async () => {
  const mock = getUsersInterceptor();

  // Some test
  renderApp();

  expect(await screen.findByText(mock.data[0])).toBeVisible();
});
```
