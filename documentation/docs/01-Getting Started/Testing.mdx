## Introduction

Testing is one of the best things Hyper Fetch has to offer. With our architecture approach and focus on global singleton
structure, our tests can be largely based on the configuration we prepare for our application. Thanks to this, the tests
are no longer sensitive to micro changes (like changing endpoints or types). Everything here reacts and adapts to our
tests or shows the appropriate error - they are easier to maintain and faster to write.

---

## Benefits

- Our setup is always up to date with the production solution
- No duplication of the configurations and setups
- Easy maintenance of the tests
- Tests are faster to build

---

## Isolation

Architecture solution makes global module out of builder. This way it will get mixed between test cases from different
filles if we run them in many workers. To prevent this we need to follow two steps for full isolation.

1. **`Clear builder`** - use built-in method `.clear()` to make sure we initialize builder submodules and clear all it's
   changes.
2. **`Clear node / runner cache`** - as for jest, you should use built-in method `.resetModules()` to clean builder
   global module and reinitialize it again. If you look for some libraries you can checkout your environment runner
   methods or try libraries like [decache](https://github.com/dwyl/decache).

## Example

In our approach we are using great mocking library [msw](https://mswjs.io/) and
[testin-library](https://testing-library.com/) but this solution works with other libraries like
[Cypress](https://www.cypress.io/). Thanks to it we can simulate the real requests and make our tests as close to
production environment as we can. Together we can create really powerfull flow that allow us to create tests with ease
and fun.

You can create the utilities set that takes command and use its method, endpoint and types to create function that allow
you to intercept request.

```tsx
import { builder } from "../api/builder";
import { getUsers } from "../api";

// 'createInterceptor' is some custom method for handling intercepting in the tests we write
// In our internal test we used MSW as main intercepting layer
const getUsersInterceptor = createInterceptor(getUsers, {
  data: [
    { name: "John", age: 18 },
    { name: "Matthew", age: 27 },
  ],
});

beforeEach(() => {
  // We need to reset modules cache as builder is globaly exported module
  // This way it will not get mixed-up with other test cases running in parallel
  jest.resetModules();
  // Clean the environment to make sure it's isolated
  builder.clear();
});

it("My test", async () => {
  // Start interceptor listener
  const mock = getUsersInterceptor();

  // Handle test
  renderApp();
  expect(await screen.findByText(mock.data[0])).toBeVisible();
});
```
