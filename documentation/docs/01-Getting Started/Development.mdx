## Structure

1. Structure is one of the most important things, so we're going to bring this topic closer and present how we approach
   it. First of all, we create a directory called `server`, inside which we keep the file `builder.ts` from which we
   export the prepared builder or more.

2. The next step is to create a directory for each entity in our system (i.e. users, todos, categories, products, groups
   ...) in which we will keep the prepared commands to be called (getUser, postUser, deleteUser) and types for query
   params, payloads, etc.

3. During such setup, we maintain maximum reusability - thanks to the class approach in the builder or commands, we have
   access to the configuration values stored by them. In this case, we can reuse the previously prepared commands,
   testers have open access to the developer configuration without the need for duplication - they use the currently
   used settings.

## Debugging

## Mocking

There are two possibilities for mocking.

1. Builtin method. If you need fast simulation of server data for development, we recommend using the built-in method on
   the `.mock ()` command. It allows you to return a previously prepared mock, and it's very handy once you have to wait
   for some endpoint to be created.

2. [MSW library](https://mswjs.io/) for intercepting of the requests. It takes more time to prepare configuration with
   this library, however this is one of the best libraries in it's category and allow you to inspect all the requests in
   browser network dev tools.
