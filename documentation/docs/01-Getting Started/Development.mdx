## Structure

1. Structure is one of the most important things, so we're going to bring this topic closer and present how we approach
   it. First of all, we create a directory to keep there our builder and commands from which we export the prepared
   elements.

2. The next step is to create a directory for each entity in our system (i.e. users, todos, categories, products, groups
   ...) and store there our commands.

3. During such setup, we maintain maximum reusability - thanks to the class approach we have access to them from any
   place. We can reuse the previously prepared commands in any component, also tests have full access to it without the
   need of setup duplication - they use the currently used settings.

```

├── api
│   ├── builder.ts
│   ├── users
│   │   ├── users.api.ts
│   │   └── index.ts
│   ├── products
│   │   ├── products.api.ts
│   │   └── index.ts
│   └── ...

└── ...
```

## Debugging

Application debugging is possible in few ways.

1. We can use the builder `setDebug (true)` method for this. It will start logging the action in the console.
2. Creating your own dev tools based on events sent from the logger.
