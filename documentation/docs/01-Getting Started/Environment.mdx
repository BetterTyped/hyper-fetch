The base version of hyper fetch should work in any javascript environment (sometimes with the need to install
polyfills).

For frameworks and libraries, we will release additional packages enriching the basic hyper fetch and adding appropriate
facilities and connections to the api of the given environment - as in the case of react with hooks.
