The core part of library should work in any javascript environment (sometimes with the need of installing polyfills).

For frameworks and libraries, we will release additional packages enriching the core hyper fetch logic and adding
appropriate facilities and connections to the api of the given environment - as in the case of react with addition of
hooks.
