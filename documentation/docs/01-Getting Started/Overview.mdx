The library starts with **ALPHA** version please have it in mind when using it, since it's still not tested as we would
like. Currently we do not recommend using it in production.

:::

**Hyper Fetch** is a library for a very wide range of uses - it provides the logic necessary to **perform requests,
caching, queuing, offline support, presistence possibilities of the queued requests and cache**. By offering the above
solutions, we have the ambition to become one of the greatest fetching tools - this is certainly not our last word, but
there are still many challenges ahead of us.

### Motivation

The idea for Hyper Fetch came from observing many projects in the Reactjs environment where there are many great fetch
libraries, but each of them is based only on providing hooks and the rest of the `fetcher` implementation is up to the
developers. However, we believe you can provide much more functionality that will run in a predictable manner in whole
application server interactions. For this reason, the work began only on building integration around Reactjs, but over
time it allowed us to understand that we can separate the library into two smaller ones - Hyper Fetch offering the logic
needed to operate all functionalities, written in vanilla javascript and React Hyper Fetch, i.e. a set of hooks to
handle commands from the main library. This allows other developers to create extensions and plugins and use the
underlying logic in any JavaScript environment!

### Main Goals

- **Caching** - to limit the requests to the server
- **Queues** - for deduplication, cancelation and chaining requests (one for fetching another for submitting)
- **Easy upload/download** - track the request status, get the eta and how much load still have to be processed
- **Offline and persistance** - to make it possible to recreate previous session with pending requests and cache no
  matter of connection status
- **No duplication of configs** - the entire environment has access to developer settings so testers and anyone can use
  the used configs without copying
- **Performance and optimization** - make it easier for infrastructure - optimize pagination, filters, infinity scroll
  etc
- **Http Client** - provided out of the box and possibility to create your own to support any backend
- **Simplicity** - get rid of many repetitive configs and automate as much as possible
