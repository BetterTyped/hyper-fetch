## Cache Overview

The cache dashboard gives you a high-level view of your cache's state, including metrics on hit rates, memory usage, and
the number of stored items. This helps you understand how effectively your caching strategy is working.

## Exploring Cached Data

You can browse a list of all items currently in the cache. Each entry shows the cache key, its size, and when it was
last updated. This allows you to:

- Verify that data is being cached as expected.
- Identify and remove stale or unnecessary entries.
- Monitor the overall size and growth of your cache.

## Inspecting Cache Entries

For deep debugging, you can drill down into individual cache entries. This detailed view shows you:

- The cached data itself.
- Metadata such as timestamps and expiration details.
- The request that originally populated the cache entry.

With this level of insight, you can easily debug complex caching behaviors, resolve stale data issues, and fine-tune
your caching logic for optimal performance.
