# Queue Management

Hyper Flow's queue management tools allow you to monitor and control the request queues in your application. This is
essential for managing offline support, request prioritization, and concurrency.

## Monitoring Queues

The queues dashboard provides a real-time list of all active request queues. You can see at a glance which queues are
running, how many requests are in each queue, and their current status.

### Key information includes:

- **Queue Name**: The identifier for each queue.
- **Request Count**: The number of pending and in-flight requests.
- **Status**: Whether the queue is active, paused, or stopped.

This overview is critical for understanding how your application handles concurrent and sequential data operations.

## Inspecting Queue Details

For more granular control, you can inspect the details of any specific queue. This view provides a complete history of
the requests that have passed through the queue, as well as those that are currently being processed or are pending.

### With this detailed view, you can:

- **Troubleshoot Stuck Requests**: Identify requests that are failing or taking too long to process.
- **Analyze Queue Flow**: Understand the order of execution and how priorities are being handled.
- **Optimize Concurrency**: Adjust your queueing strategy for better performance and reliability.

Full visibility into your queues gives you the confidence to build robust applications that can handle complex data
synchronization and network conditions gracefully.
