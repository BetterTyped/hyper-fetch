## Project Overview

The main dashboard offers a big-picture look at your application. It features visualizations and key statistics to help
you quickly assess the state of your data layer.

### Key Metrics

- **Network Activity**: Monitor incoming and outgoing requests, success rates, and error occurrences.
- **Cache Efficiency**: Track cache hits, misses, and the overall size of your cached data.
- **Queue Status**: Keep an eye on the number of active and pending requests in your queues.

This overview helps you spot trends, catch anomalies, and understand your application's behavior at a glance.

### What you can analyze:

- **Request Timings**: Identify slow requests by analyzing response times and processing durations.
- **Throughput**: Measure the rate of data transfer to and from your application.
- **Resource Usage**: Understand how different parts of your application are consuming network and cache resources.

By using these insights, you can pinpoint bottlenecks, optimize slow queries, and deliver a faster, more responsive
experience to your users.
