# Network Inspector

The Network Inspector is a powerful tool for monitoring and debugging all HTTP requests made by your application. It
provides a real-time stream of network activity, allowing you to inspect every detail of a request's lifecycle.

## Real-time Monitoring

The inspector displays a list of all network requests, which you can filter and search to quickly find what you need.
This is invaluable for:

- **Debugging**: See if requests are being sent as expected.
- **Quality Assurance**: Verify that the correct data is being transmitted.
- **Performance Tuning**: Identify redundant or slow API calls.

Each entry in the list provides a summary of the request, including the method, endpoint, status, and response time.

## Detailed Request Inspection

When you need a closer look, you can select any request to open a detailed view. This view is organized into several
tabs, giving you access to all information about the request and its response.

### What you can inspect:

- **Headers**: View the full set of request and response headers.
- **Payload**: Examine the data sent with `POST`, `PUT`, or `PATCH` requests.
- **Response**: See the raw response body from the server.
- **Timings**: Analyze the time spent in each phase of the request lifecycle.

This level of detail makes it easy to spot issues with authentication, data formatting, or server responses, helping you
resolve bugs faster.
