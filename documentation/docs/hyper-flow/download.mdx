# Download

HyperFlow is a cross-platform application available for macOS, Windows, and Linux. Below you can find the appropriate
installation package for your operating system.

## macOS

For macOS, we provide a `.dmg` file that allows for easy installation. We also offer a `.zip` archive for manual
installation. HyperFlow is optimized for both Intel and Apple Silicon architectures.
