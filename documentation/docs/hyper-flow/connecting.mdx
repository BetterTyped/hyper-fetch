Hyper Flow is a devtool that provides real-time insights into your application's requests, cache, and queue, making
debugging and development faster and more efficient. Connecting it to your Hyper Fetch client is straightforward.

---

:::tip Purpose

This guide will walk you through connecting the Hyper Fetch Devtools plugin to your client instance. You will learn how
to:

1.  **Install** the necessary devtools package.
2.  **Initialize** and **connect** the devtools plugin to your Hyper Fetch client.
3.  **Verify** the connection and start monitoring your requests.

## Step-by-step Guide

Connecting the devtools is a simple process that involves installing the plugin and adding it to your client.

1. ### Installation

First, you need to install the `@hyper-fetch/plugin-devtools` package.

```npm2yarn2pnpm
npm install @hyper-fetch/plugin-devtools
```

2. ### Connecting to the Client

Once installed, import `DevtoolsPlugin` and `createClient`. Then, use the `client.addPlugin` method to connect it. The
plugin requires an `appName` to identify your application in the devtools.

/>

```typescript title="api/client.ts"
import { createClient } from "@hyper-fetch/core";
import { DevtoolsPlugin } from "@hyper-fetch/plugin-devtools";

// Create a client instance
export const client = createClient({
  url: "https://api.your-app.com",
  // highlight-start
}).addPlugin(DevtoolsPlugin({ appName: "My Awesome App" })); // Add the plugin to the client
// highlight-end
```

You should replace `"My Awesome App"` with a name that uniquely identifies your application in Hyper Flow.

3. ### Verifying the Connection

Once you've added the plugin, run your application and make a request using Hyper Fetch. If the connection is
successful, you will see your application appear in the Hyper Flow devtools, and your requests will be logged in
real-time.

This setup is typically done once in a central file where you configure your Hyper Fetch client.
