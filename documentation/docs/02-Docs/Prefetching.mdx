## Description

**`Prefetching`** in Hyper Fetch is very easy. To do a prefetch query, we just need to execute the query through any
queue - preferably using the method on Command. In this way, we will keep the standard flow of the request, which will
be handled in the normal way.

```tsx
import { getUsers } from "./users.server";

// Add this in the right place and simply prefetch the data keeping standard flow and loading / caching events to be emitted
getUsers.send();
```
