- `options`: ClientOptions - options for a fetching client. By default, it refers to the implemented XHR Client that
  fulfills the basic `XMLHttpRequest` interface.

  with the possibility for changing the storage.

- `fetchQueue`: FetchQueue - fetching queue
- `submitQueue`: - queue - submit queue

## Available Methods

- `setClient` - allows for setting own fetching client
- `onError` - setting callback that happens in case of any request error. # TODO -> example with connecting sentry
- `onRequest`- allows for setting _multiple_ callbacks that happen before sending a request.
  - TODO -> example with separate header modification and data modification.
  - TODO -> example with automatic header authentication for all requests.
- `onResponse` - allows for setting _multiple_ callbacks that happen after sending a request.
- `clear` - clears all the listeners, queues and storages. Mainly used for tests.
- `create` - indicates that the builder setup is _complete_. Returns the `Command`.
