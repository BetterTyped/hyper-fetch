## Introduction

**`Cache`** is responsible for storing response data from the requests. It uses an event system that successively
transmits data and takes care of reavalidation in the system. Data is stored under `cacheKey` in the storage which by
default is a Map object, but can be replaced to any other compatible interface.

---

## Purpose

- `Storing` requests results
- `Managing` stored data
- `Emitting` storage events

---

## CacheKey

The cache stores data on a `key-value` basis. The key is always specified inside the Command as `cacheKey`, and it
determines where the data is stored and it's used for propagation of the data handling events. The cacheKey value is
automatically determined by default based on parameters such as the method, endpoint and query params of the given
command, but there is nothing to prevent you from adding the key manually when setting the Command or using one of its
methods. Thanks to the automatic way of indexing data in the cache, we do not have to worry about paginated keys in the
data - everything will happen automatically.

## Events

Configuration options

{@import Hyper-Fetch getCacheEvents returns}

## Storages

By default, the cache uses Map as a data retention location. However, it is possible to replace the place where the data
is stored in the system. We can use local storage, indexeddb - no matter if the source works synchronously or
asynchronously.

This way we can setup the `Persistent` storage that will last between sessions.

```tsx
export const builder = new FetchBuilder<ServerErrorType>({
  baseUrl: "localhost:3000",
  cache: (instance) =>
    new Cache(instance, {
      storage,
    }),
});
```

---

## Presistance

We can achieve the persistance of the stored data by changing the cache storage to persistent one. It needs to match the
provided interface.

:::info

Currently there is no cross tabs synchronization. It's planned for next releases when we will have more insights from
our internal testing.

## Lifecycle

Cache options can be provided with some lifefcycle methods. These are events such as `onInitialization`.

## Parameters
