## Description

**`Cache`** is where the response data from the queues is stored. It uses an event system that successively transmits
data to listeners and takes care of their proper refreshing in the system, tracking data refresh and error checking on
retried requests.

## Data keys

The cache stores data on a `key-value` basis. The key is always specified inside the Command as cacheKey, and it
determines where the data is stored. The cacheKey value is automatically determined by default based on parameters such
as the method, endpoint and query params of the given command, but there is nothing to prevent you from adding the key
manually when setting the Command or using one of its methods. Thanks to the automatic way of indexing data in the
cache, we do not have to worry about paginated keys in the data - everything will happen automatically.

## Storages

By default, the cache uses Map as a data retention location. However, it is possible to replace the place where the data
is stored in the system. We can use local storage, indexeddb - no matter if the source works synchronously or
asynchronously.

This way we can setup the `Persistent` storage that will last between sessions.

```tsx
export const builder = new FetchBuilder<ServerErrorType>({
  baseUrl: "localhost:3000",
  cache: (instance) =>
    new Cache(instance, {
      storage,
    }),
}).build();
```
