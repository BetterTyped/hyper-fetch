## Description

**`Client`** is a function that is responsible for communication with the server. The default hyper fetch client is used
to communicate with the Rest Api server. However, there is nothing to prevent us from changing and creating the client
we need. Thanks to event communication, we can set our own client as we wish.

:::caution

If there is no XHR in the window object or the XHR object is a polyfill in your environment, you have to install a npm
package [xmlhttprequest](https://www.npmjs.com/package/xmlhttprequest) and set it on the window object.

:::

By default, the client is responsible for requests, but its role is very significant for many other elements - such as
tracking the progress of requests, canceling them, stringify of query params, lifecycle methods of request - like
request start / end, response start / end. It also applies all the middlewares and interceptors to the whole requesting
process.

### Custom Client

You can connect any client to communicate with the server and handle it as you want, the only thing that has to match is
the interface of the output.

```tsx
const customHttpClient: ClientType = (command: FetchCommandInstance) => Promise.resolve([null, null, 0]);

const builder = new FetchBuilder({ baseUrl }).setClient(customHttpClient);
```
