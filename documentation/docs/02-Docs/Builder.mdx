## Introduction

**`FetchBuilder`** is a class that allows you to configure the connection to the server. It initializes the subsystems
of the entire library - such as queues, caches, interceptors, and allows you to create, based on its settings, commands
necessary to execute requests. In this way, the data and information flow remains locked inside a given builder - it is
isolated and does not affect other builders.

It was designed to be used as a singleton, where the builder helps us create a global structure for making server
requests, without duplicating logic in different parts of the application. In this approach, we can easily create a
solid structure and architecture of our application, which additionally facilitates the maintenance of tests by dividing
the necessary configurations and types.

---

## Purpose

- `Orchestration` of the components and flow of the library
- `Creating commands` to provide global setups and environment
- `Isolation` from other builders and their events

---

## Initialization

```tsx
import { FetchBuilder } from "@better-typed/hyper-fetch";

export const builder = new FetchBuilder({ baseUrl: "http://localhost:3000" });
```

---

## Setup of defaults

Due to the fact that the components in hyper fetch are created inside the builder, we can set global or default values
for our system on it.

#### Command default setup

We can use the `setCommandConfig` method to specify the defaults for every created command

#### Client request options default setup

We can use the `setRequestConfig` method to specify the defaults for every request. This method is based on the builder
typescript generic which allow you to pass any options you need for your client.

---

## Features

### Authentication

When we want to send authenticated request we have to setup the `onAuth` interceptor and setup the command with the
`auth` option set to true.

[Read More](/guides/Basic/Authentication)

### Pre-Request Interceptor

When you need to use the pre-request interceptor to modify command before it get's send, you can use the `onRequest`
builder method.

### Post-Request Interceptors

There are several possibilities to intercept the response from command. You can do it with methods:

- `onError` which is triggered on request error response
- `onSuccess` which is triggered on request success response
- `onResponse` which is triggered on any response

### Query Params

Builder has the built in query params encoding fuction, you can modify it's options as you want or provide your own
function.

You can change it's setup with `setQueryParamsConfig` method and options listed bellow.

{@import Hyper-Fetch QueryStringifyOptions returns}

To change the encoding function you can use `setStringifyQueryParams` method.

```tsx
builder.setStringifyQueryParams((value: string) => encode(value));
```

### Header Mapper

By default header mapper behaves very simple. It checks for the content to be FormData or json, and provide correct
headers to the request. You can do much advanced setups with the `setHeaderMapper` that allows you to define custom
logic that will be triggered before every request made in the builder.

### Payload Mapper

It's main default responsibility is to check if data is instance of FormData or not. Based on this details, we can
stringify non-FormData values or just pass the FormData to the request to be made. This way file upload is supported out
of the box.

---

## Typescript

Builder has two generic types.

```tsx
class FetchBuilder<GlobalErrorType, RequestConfigType>
```

- `GlobalErrorType` defines the error type used in all of the commands it should consist of `Error` type and your
  default `ServerErrorType`. For the individual error types needed in some commands you can setup the `LocalErrorType`
  for each individual command.

- `RequestConfigType` is the generic responsible for shaping the options passed to the client. Most likely you will
  change it only when you provide your custom client.

## Components

### [Cache](/api/Hyper-Fetch/Class/Cache)

Handles data storages and persistance. Can be adjusted with options when initializing builder.

---

### [Client](/api/Hyper-Fetch/Function/fetchClient)

Handles all requests within builder. Can be replaced with `setClient` method.

---

### [SubmitDispatcher](/api/Hyper-Fetch/Class/Dispatcher)

Handles the mutation requests and queueing. Can be adjusted with options when initializing builder.

---

### [FetchDispatcher](/api/Hyper-Fetch/Class/Dispatcher)

Handles the fetching requests and queueing. Can be adjusted with options when initializing builder.

---

### [AppManager](/api/Hyper-Fetch/Class/AppManager)

Handles the app focus and online state. Can be adjusted with options when initializing builder.

---

### [CommandManager](/api/Hyper-Fetch/Class/CommandManager)

Handles additional events and cancelation of requests. Can be adjusted with options when initializing builder.

---

### [LoggerManager](/api/Hyper-Fetch/Class/LoggerManager)

Handles the logging systems for debugging.

---

## Parameters

Configuration options

{@import Hyper-Fetch FetchBuilderConfig returns}

<!-- ## Authentication

1. Adding the headers to the request during authentication

```tsx
export const builder = new FetchBuilder({ baseUrl }).onAuth((command) => {
  const state = store.getState();
  const authToken = state.auth.token;

  // Before each command with setting "auth: true" add the Bearer token
  return command.setHeaders({
    ...command.headers,
    Authorization: `Bearer ${authToken}`,
  });
});

export const getUsers = builder.createCommand<{ name: string; email: string }>()({
  method: "GET",
  endpoint: "/users",
  auth: true, // Important!
});
```

2. Refreshing the token

```tsx
export const builder = new FetchBuilder({ baseUrl }).onError(async (res, command) => {
  const status = res[2];
  const refreshToken = localStorage.getItem(REFRESH_TOKEN_STORAGE_FIELD);

  // Check if command has the used value - this will ensure you will not go into infinite loop
  if (!command.used && refreshToken && status === 401) {
    // Prepare the refresh token command
    const postRefreshToken = builder.createCommand<LoginResponse, LoginData>()({
      endpoint: "/refresh-token",
      method: "POST",
    });

    // Call the command to receive new tokens
    const [data] = await postRefreshToken.setData({ refreshToken }).exec();

    if (data) {
      // Safe the new tokens
      localStorage.setItem(TOKEN_STORAGE_FIELD, data.token);
      localStorage.setItem(REFRESH_TOKEN_STORAGE_FIELD, data.refreshToken);
      // Repeat the request
      return command.setUsed(true).send();
    }
  }
  // Return the initial response is something goes wrong
  return res;
});
``` -->
