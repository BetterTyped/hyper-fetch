## Introduction

**`FetchEffect`** is basically a set of reducers reacting to the request lifecycle. We can assign it to the builder and
it's `effectKey` has to be the same as command's effect key so we can match it. It's strength lays in the possibilities
of cooperation with the persistant queues. Imagine that we always want to trigger some logic when the request is
successfull, but we also use the persistant storages to save or ongoing requests. When our app gets relaunched there is
no possibility to persist functions and logic - so the effect comes with the solution. We can assign it on builder
creation so it will instantly match all the ongoing requests from previous sessions.
