The `generate` command is a tool that allows you to generate a ready-to-use Hyper-Fetch client, typed requests and data
models based on your schema. It supports multiple templates, including OpenAPI and Swagger.

```bash
npx hyper-fetch@latest generate
```

---

:::tip Purpose

By using the code generator, you can:

1.  **Automatically generate** a ready-to-use Hyper-Fetch client.
2.  **Create typed requests** for all your API endpoints.
3.  **Define data models** based on your schema components.
4.  **Boost productivity** by eliminating manual setup for API integration.

## Usage

You can use it in two ways - by going through wizard or passing individual arguments.

Remember to initialize a project first - this way hyper-fetch will be able to find the project's configuration and
generate files in the correct location.

:::info Initialize a project

If you don't have a project yet, you can initialize one with the [`init`](/docs/cli/init) command.

```bash
npx hyper-fetch@latest init
```

:::

1. ### Wizard

To use the wizard, run the following command:

```bash
npx hyper-fetch@latest generate
```

It will guide you through the process of generating the client, requests and data models.

2. ### Custom arguments

You can also pass individual arguments to the command. Which is useful for the scripts.

```bash
npx hyper-fetch@latest generate --template openapi --url https://petstore3.swagger.io/api/v3/openapi.json --output ./client.ts
```
