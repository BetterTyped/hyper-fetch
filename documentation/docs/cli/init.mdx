the default configuration.

```

:::tip Purpose

By using the `init` command, you can:

1.  **Guided Setup**: Initialize your project with an interactive wizard.
2.  **Centralized Configuration**: Create an `api.json` to manage all code generation settings.
3.  **Path Aliases**: Automatically detect and configure TypeScript/JavaScript path aliases.
4.  **Foundation for Codegen**: Prepare your project for the `generate` command.

## Usage

You can use it by going through wizard which will ask you about the project's configuration.

To use the wizard, run the following command:

```bash
npx hyper-fetch@latest init

It will guide you through the process of generating the `api.json` configuration. This file will be used by other
commands and will allow us to generate files in the correct locations with correct imports paths.
