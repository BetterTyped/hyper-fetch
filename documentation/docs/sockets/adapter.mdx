[Read the API Reference Â»](/api/sockets/Classes/SocketAdapter.mdx)

Adapter is a class that specify the way how to communicate with the server. It defines the way how to send and receive
data, how to handle errors, how to handle reconnects, etc. Currently supporting connection types like `Websocket`,
`Server Sent Events (SSE)` or integrations like `Firebase Realtime Database`.

## Built in Adapters

There are two built in adapters - `WebsocketAdapter` and `ServerSentEventsAdapter` providing basic functionality for the
`Websocket` and `Server Sent Events (SSE)` connection types.

---

### Websocket Adapter

The default adapter is used to communicate with the `Websocket` server.

(@import sockets WebsocketAdapter type=import)

```tsx
import { WebsocketAdapter } from "@hyper-fetch/sockets";

const socket = new Socket({
  url: "http://localhost:3000",
  adapter: WebsocketAdapter(),
});
```

### Server Sent Events (SSE) Adapter

The `ServerSentEventsAdapter` is used to communicate with the `Server Sent Events (SSE)` server.

(@import sockets ServerSentEventsAdapter type=import)

```tsx
import { ServerSentEventsAdapter } from "@hyper-fetch/sockets";

const socket = new Socket({
  url: "http://localhost:3000",
  adapter: ServerSentEventsAdapter(),
});
```

## Custom Adapter

There is nothing to prevent you from changing this and creating the adapter you need. Thanks to event communication, you
can set your own adapter as you wish by only fulfilling the typescript requirements. This way you can create your own
adapters for existing libraries like `socket.io`.
