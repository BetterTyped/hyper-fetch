The `Listener` class is a key component of Hyper Fetch's real-time communication capabilities. It provides a **powerful,
type-safe way to define, configure, and manage event listeners** for data coming from a server through sockets. By
encapsulating all the details needed to listen for an event—such as the topic and data structure—`Listener` ensures
consistency, predictability, and flexibility in how your application handles real-time updates.

With a strict and predictable data structure, `Listener` makes it easy to build features that react to live events with
confidence. Its design, especially when paired with TypeScript, helps you create robust, maintainable, and interactive
applications by ensuring that the data you receive from the server matches the types you expect.

---

:::tip Purpose

1.  To create **consistent and reusable event listener templates**.
2.  To **standardize the data schema** for incoming real-time events.
3.  To provide a **consistent API** for listening to events, regardless of the underlying adapter.
4.  To **hold instructions** on how to connect to specific event topics.
5.  To ensure that incoming event data is **strongly-typed** and structured, making it safe and easy to work with.

## Initialization

A `Listener` should be initialized from a `Socket` instance using the `createListener` method. This approach ensures
that the listener shares a common communication manager with the rest of your application, promoting a unified
architecture for handling real-time data.

```tsx
import { socket } from "./socket";

export const onChatMessage = socket.createListener<ChatMessageType>()({
  topic: "chat-message",
});

export const onUserStatusChange = socket.createListener<UserStatusType>()({
  topic: "status",
});
```

---

## Usage

### Listening for Events

To begin receiving events, use the `listen` method and provide a callback function. This function will be executed each
time a new event is received on the specified topic. The data passed to the callback will be automatically typed based
on the generic you provided during initialization.

```tsx
onChatMessage.listen({
  callback: (message) => {
    // `message` is automatically typed as ChatMessageType
    console.log(message);
  },
});
```

### Stopping a Listener

The `listen` method returns a function that, when called, will remove that specific listener. This is the standard way
to clean up and stop listening for events, for example, when a component unmounts.

```tsx
// The listen method returns a function to remove the listener
const removeListener = onChatMessage.listen({ callback: (message) => console.log(message) });

// ...sometime later...

// Call the returned function to stop listening
removeListener();
```

You can also interact with the underlying adapter to remove listeners, which can be useful for more advanced scenarios,
such as removing all listeners for a given event topic.

```tsx
const callback = ({ data }) => console.log(data);
const unmountListener = onChatMessage.listen({ callback });

// ...

// Remove ALL listeners for the 'chat-message' topic
socket.adapter.listeners.delete(onChatMessage.topic);

// Remove a *single* specific listener from the 'chat-message' topic
socket.adapter.listeners.get(onChatMessage.topic)?.delete(callback);
```

### Listen Only Once

If you only need to handle the next event that comes in, you can simply call the `removeListener` function from within
your callback.

```tsx
const removeEvent = onChatMessage.listen({
  callback: (message) => {
    console.log(message);
    removeEvent(); // Stop listening after the first event
  },
});
```

## Features

Here are some of the features of the `Listener` class.

---

### Dynamic Topics

Listeners support dynamic topics with parameters, similar to requests. This allows you to create reusable listener
templates for resources that require an identifier, such as a specific chat room or user.

Define the parameter in the `topic` string with a colon prefix (e.g., `:id`).

```ts
export const onNoteChange = socket.createListener<NoteData>()({
  topic: "notes/:noteId",
});
```

Then, use the `setParams` method to provide a value for the parameter before you start listening. Each listener with a
different parameter will be treated as a separate event stream.

```ts
// Listen to events for note with ID 1
onNoteChange.setParams({ noteId: 1 }).listen(/* ... */);

// Listen to events for note with ID 2
onNoteChange.setParams({ noteId: 2 }).listen(/* ... */);
```

---

### Global Data Hooks

You can use the `onData` method to create a "global" hook for a listener template. This callback will be triggered for
_every_ event that matches the listener's topic, even when dynamic parameters are used. It's an excellent way to
centralize logic that needs to react to any event of a certain type, regardless of its specific parameters.

```ts
export const onNoteChange = socket
  .createListener<NoteData>()({
    topic: "notes/:noteId",
  })
  .onData((event) => {
    // This will be called for any note change, regardless of the 'noteId'
    console.log("A note changed:", event.data);
  });

onNoteChange.setParams({ noteId: 1 }).listen(/* ... */);
onNoteChange.setParams({ noteId: 2 }).listen(/* ... */);

// The onData callback will fire for events on both `notes/1` and `notes/2`
```

---

### Integration with Hyper Fetch

A powerful use case for the `onData` hook is to create a seamless integration with Hyper Fetch's caching layer. When you
receive a real-time update, you can use it to instantly update the relevant cached data from a `Request`. This keeps
your application's state synchronized without needing to re-fetch data from the server.

Here's an example of updating a cached note when an update event is received via a socket.

```ts
// 1. Your core client and request setup
const client = new Client({ url: "http://localhost:3000" });
const getNote = client.createRequest()({
  topic: "/notes/:noteId",
});

// 2. Your realtime listener with a data hook
export const onNoteChange = socket
  .createListener<NoteData>()({
    topic: "notes/:noteId",
  })
  .onData((event) => {
    const { noteId } = event.data;

    // 3. Create a request instance that matches the cache entry
    const noteRequest = getNote.setParams({ noteId });

    // 4. Update the cache with the new data from the socket event
    client.cache.update(noteRequest, (prevData) => {
      return { ...prevData, data: event.data };
    });
  });
```

## Methods

The `Listener` class offers a suite of methods to configure and interact with a listener instance. You can find a
comprehensive list of these methods and their detailed descriptions in the API reference.

It is crucial to understand how methods on a `Listener` instance operate to ensure predictable behavior in your
application.

:::danger Methods Return Clones

Methods on a `Listener` instance (e.g., `setParams`, `setOptions`) do not modify the original listener instance in
place. Instead, they return a **new, cloned instance** of the listener with the specified modifications applied. The
original listener instance remains unchanged.

**Always use the returned new instance for subsequent operations.** This immutable approach ensures isolation between
different listener configurations and prevents unintended side effects.

:::

```tsx
// ❌ WRONG
const listener = onChatMessage;

// This returns a *new* listener instance, but it's not being assigned or used.
// The original `listener` variable remains unchanged.
listener.setOptions({ ... });

// This will listen without the options you intended to apply.
listener.listen();
```

```tsx
// ✅ CORRECT
const listener = onChatMessage;

// Assign the new, cloned listener with options to a new variable
const listenerWithOptions = listener.setOptions({ ... });

// Use the correctly configured listener
listenerWithOptions.listen();

// ✅ Also correct (method chaining)
onChatMessage
  .setOptions({ ... })
  .listen();
```

---

## Configuration

You can provide additional configuration options when creating a listener to customize its behavior. These options are
passed in the object to `createListener`.

```ts
// 1. Initialize the socket
const socket = new Socket({
  url: "ws://localhost:3000",
});

// 2. Create the listener template
const listener = socket.createListener<{ message: string }>()({
  topic: "chat-message",
});
```

## TypeScript

The `Listener` class is designed with TypeScript at its core to provide a superior developer experience and robust type
safety for real-time events.

### Response Type

When you create a listener, you should provide the type of the data you expect to receive in the event as a generic.
This ensures that the `data` passed to your `listen` and `onData` callbacks is fully typed, enabling autocompletion and
preventing common errors.

```ts
// Define the type for your event data
type ChatMessageType = {
  id: string;
  author: string;
  message: string;
  timestamp: number;
};

// Provide it as a generic to createListener
const onChatMessage = socket.createListener<ChatMessageType>()({
  topic: "chat-message",
});

onChatMessage.listen(({ data }) => {
  // `data` is now strongly-typed as ChatMessageType
  console.log(data.message);
  console.log(data.author);
  // error-next-line
  console.log(data.nonExistentProperty); // TypeScript Error
});
```

This simple yet powerful feature eliminates guesswork and ensures that your application correctly handles the data
structures sent by the server.
