**`React Hyper Fetch`** is a data fetching library which implements the core features of the core library and adapting
it to the React environment. It handles everything from fetching, submitting, queueing the requests and their management
in the system. Together with the provided hooks, maintaining and writing new functionalities becomes trivial.

The minimum requirement to use `hooks` is to have a prevoiusly prepared [**command**](/docs/Architecture/Command).

## Usage

To use hooks, we need to initialize builder and the commands instances that will be then consumed as properties. Take a
look at the [Quick Start](/docs/Getting%20Started/Quick%20Start).

```tsx
const { data, error, loading } = useFetch(getUsers);
```

```tsx
const { submit, data, error, submitting } = useSubmit(postLogin);
```

## Helper hooks

Code readability has always been an important factor for us, so to break down our hook setups into smaller parts, we
implemented helper hooks. The concept is that the main hook returns minor helpers, thanks to which we can segregate our
logic into smaller parts. It's quite simple as on the example below.

```tsx
const {
  data,
  error,
  loading,
  onRequestStart,
  onResponseStart,
  onSuccess,
  onError,
  onDownloadProgress,
  onUploadProgress,
  onFinished,
  onAbort,
  onOffline,
} = useFetch(getUsers);

onRequestStart(({ details, command }) => {
  // Do something on query start
});

onResponseStart(({ response, details, command }) => {
  // Do something when query starts returning response
});

onSuccess(({ response, details, command }) => {
  // Do something on query success
});

onError(({ response, details, command }) => {
  // Do something on query fail
});

onAbort(({ response, details, command }) => {
  // Do something on query cancelation
});

onOffline(({ response, details, command }) => {
  // Do something when query goes stale while offline
});

onFinished(({ response, details, command }) => {
  // Do something on query finished (success or false)
});

onDownloadProgress(({ response, details, command }) => {
  // Do something on query finished (success or false)
});
```
