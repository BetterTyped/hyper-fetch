**`React Hyper Fetch`** is a data fetching library which implements the core features of the core library and adapting
it to the React environment. It handles everything from fetching, submitting, queueing the requests and their management
in the system. Together with the provided hooks, maintaining and writing new functionalities becomes trivial.

The minimum requirement to use `hooks` is to have a prevoiusly prepared [**command**](/docs/Docs/Command).

# Usage

To use hooks, we need to initialize builder and the commands instances that will be then consumed as properties. Take a
look at the [Quick Start](/docs/Getting%20Started/Quick%20Start).

```tsx
const { data, error, loading } = useFetch(getUsers);
```

```tsx
const { submit, data, error, submitting } = useSubmit(postLogin);
```
