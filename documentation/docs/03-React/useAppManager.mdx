## Introduction

Thanks to this hook, we are able to use information about the connection status and screen focus state. Additionally, we
also have options to manipulate it's global state. This hook uses the [`AppManager`](/docs/Docs/Managers) available on
the [`Builder`](/docs/Docs/Builder) instance.

It returns the status of `isOnline` and `isFocused`, and the actions that allow you to change them.

```tsx
const { isOnline, setOnline } = useAppManager(builder);

setOnline(true);
```

```tsx
const { isFocused, setFocused } = useAppManager(builder);

setFocused(true);
```

## Returns

Returned values from this hook.

```tsx
const values = useAppManager(builder);
```

{@import ReactHyperFetch useAppManager returns}
