**`React Native`** is supported by our library as the `Hyper Fetch` was written to support as many environments as
possible. Thanks to this, the structure of the base library is very generic and modular. This means that we can freely
replace a large part of the components.

## Online / Offline status handling

Default events responsible for the online / offline status in the library are based on the events available in the web
browsers environment. To use the solutions available on mobile devices, we can freely change the code responsible for
handling the connection status.

```tsx
export const builder = new Builder<ServerErrorType>({
  baseUrl: environment.serverUrl,
  appManager: (instance) =>
    new AppManager(instance, {
      initiallyOnline: NetInfo.fetch().then((state) => state.isConnected),
      onlineEvent: (setOnline) =>
        NetInfo.addEventListener((state) => {
          setOnline(state.isConnected);
        }),
    }),
});
```

## Application focus / blur state

When you want to handle the functions needed to perform requests when the user is actively using the application or
not - you can use similar logic as in the case of online / offline status

```tsx
export const builder = new Builder<ServerErrorType>({
  baseUrl: environment.serverUrl,
  appManager: (instance) =>
    new AppManager(instance, {
      focusEvent: (setFocused) =>
        ...,
      blurEvent: (setBlurred) =>
        ...,
    }),
});
```

## Particular screen focus / blur state

If we want to implement such logic for a specific screen, we have to use custom solutions where we can track the focus
state of the screen and hook it into revalidation.

```tsx
import React from "react";
import { useFocusEffect } from "@react-navigation/native";

export function useFocusRevalidation(revalidate: () => void) {
  const initialized = React.useRef(true);

  useFocusEffect(
    React.useCallback(() => {
      if (initialized.current) {
        initialized.current = false;
      } else {
        revalidate();
      }
    }, [revalidate]),
  );
}
```

```tsx
const { data, error, loading, revalidate } = useFetch(getUsers);

useFocusRevalidation(revalidate);
```
