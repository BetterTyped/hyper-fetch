Hyper-Fetch and React-Hyper-Fetch were written with different environments in which they can be used. Thanks to this,
the structure of the base library is very generic and modular. This means that we can freely replace a large part of the
components. In addition, a large part is written in vanilla js, thanks to which we maintain greater stability of our
solutions between environments.

## Online / Offline status handling

Default events responsible for the online / offline status in the library are based on the events available in the web
browsers environment. To use the solutions available on mobile devices, we can freely change the code responsible for
handling the connection status.

```tsx
export const builder = new FetchBuilder<ServerErrorType>({
  baseUrl: environment.serverUrl,
  appManager: (instance) =>
    new AppManager(instance, {
      onlineEvent: (setOnline) =>
        NetInfo.addEventListener((state) => {
          setOnline(state.isConnected);
        }),
    }),
});
```

```tsx
builder.appManager.setOnline(true);
```

```tsx
const { isOnline, setOnline } = useAppManager(builder);

setOnline(true);
```

## Application focus / blur state

When you want to handle the functions needed to perform requests when the user is actively using the application or
not - you can use similar logic as in the case of online / offline status

```tsx
export const builder = new FetchBuilder<ServerErrorType>({
  baseUrl: environment.serverUrl,
  appManager: (instance) =>
    new AppManager(instance, {
      focusEvent: (setFocused) =>
        ...,
      blurEvent: (setBlured) =>
        ...,
    }),
});
```

```tsx
builder.appManager.setFocused(true);
```

```tsx
const { isFocused, setFocused } = useAppManager(builder);

setFocused(true);
```

## Particular screen focus / blur state

If we want to implement such logic for a specific screen, we have to use custom solutions where we can use Hooks to
block requests by prop disabled.
