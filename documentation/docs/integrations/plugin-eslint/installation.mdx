# Installation

This guide will help you install and set up the Hyper Fetch ESLint plugin in your project.

## Prerequisites

Before installing the ESLint plugin, ensure you have the following prerequisites:

- Node.js (v12 or later)
- npm or yarn
- ESLint already installed in your project
- Hyper Fetch installed in your project

## Install the Plugin

Install the ESLint plugin using npm or yarn:

```bash
# Using npm
npm install eslint-plugin-hyper-fetch --save-dev

# Using yarn
yarn add eslint-plugin-hyper-fetch --dev
```

## Update ESLint Configuration

After installing the plugin, you need to update your ESLint configuration file (`.eslintrc.js`, `.eslintrc.json`, or
equivalent) to use the plugin.

### Recommended Configuration

The simplest way to use the plugin is to extend the recommended configuration:

```json
{
  "extends": [
    // ... your other extends
    "plugin:hyper-fetch/recommended"
  ]
}
```

This will automatically enable all rules with their recommended settings.

### Next Steps

Now that you've installed the plugin, proceed to the
[Configuration](/documentation/docs/integrations/plugin-eslint/configuration.mdx) section to learn about customizing the
plugin settings or read about the available [Rules](/documentation/docs/integrations/plugin-eslint/rules.mdx) to
understand what issues the plugin helps you identify.
