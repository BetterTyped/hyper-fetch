# Rules

The Hyper Fetch ESLint plugin includes several rules to help you catch common issues when working with Hyper Fetch. This
page describes each rule, explains what it checks for, and provides examples of code that would trigger the rule.

## client-generic-types

This rule ensures proper generic types are used when creating clients with Hyper Fetch. It extends TypeScript's
functionality to trace issues with object-like generic types that might otherwise be missed.

### Description

The rule checks for:

- Unexpected generic type properties that don't match the expected interface
- Empty generic type objects (`{}`)
- Generic types that don't match the expected object-like format

### Examples of Issues Caught

**Unexpected generic type:**

```tsx
// ❌ Error: Unexpected generic type(s) found: nonExistingGenericType
import { createClient } from "@hyper-fetch/core";
const someClient = createClient<{ nonExistingGenericType: any }>({ url: "http://localhost:3000" });
```

**Empty generic type:**

```tsx
// ❌ Error: Generic type provided to createClient is empty
import { createClient } from "@hyper-fetch/core";
const someClient = createClient<{}>({ url: "http://localhost:3000" });
```

**Non-object-like generic type:**

```tsx
// ❌ Error: Generic type provided to createClient is not matching the expected object-like format
import { createClient } from "@hyper-fetch/core";
const someClient = createClient<unknown>({ url: "http://localhost:3000" });
```

### Configuration

Default severity: `"error"`

## request-generic-types

This rule ensures proper generic types are used when creating requests with Hyper Fetch. It extends TypeScript's
functionality to trace issues with object-like generic types that might otherwise be missed.

### Description

The rule checks for:

- Unexpected generic type properties that don't match the expected interface
- Empty generic type objects (`{}`)
- Generic types that don't match the expected object-like format

### Examples of Issues Caught

**Unexpected generic type:**

```tsx
// ❌ Error: Unexpected generic type(s) found: nonExistingGenericType
import { client } from "./client";
const request = client.createRequest<{ nonExistingGenericType: any }>({ endpoint: "/api/users" });
```

**Empty generic type:**

```tsx
// ❌ Error: Generic type provided to createRequest is empty
import { client } from "./client";
const request = client.createRequest<{}>({ endpoint: "/api/users" });
```

**Non-object-like generic type:**

```tsx
// ❌ Error: Generic type provided to createRequest is not matching the expected object-like format
import { client } from "./client";
const request = client.createRequest<unknown>({ endpoint: "/api/users" });
```

### Configuration

Default severity: `"error"`

## When to Use These Rules

These rules are particularly useful for:

1. Large codebases where multiple developers might be working with Hyper Fetch
2. Projects where type safety is critical
3. Applications where you want to ensure consistent usage of Hyper Fetch
4. Preventing subtle type-related bugs that might only manifest at runtime
