# ESLint Plugin

The **`eslint-plugin-hyper-fetch`** extends your development experience by providing custom ESLint rules specifically
designed to catch common issues when working with Hyper Fetch. These rules help identify problems with generic types
that TypeScript alone might not catch, such as typos, missing values, or incorrect type usage.

## Overview

The plugin currently provides the following rules:

- **`client-generic-types`**: Ensures proper generic types when creating clients
- **`request-generic-types`**: Validates generic types when creating requests

These rules extend TypeScript's capabilities by performing deeper analysis of your code, catching issues before they
cause runtime problems.

## Key Benefits

- **Better Type Safety**: Catch generic type errors that TypeScript might miss
- **Improved Developer Experience**: Get immediate feedback on type-related issues
- **Reduced Runtime Errors**: Prevent bugs caused by incorrect type usage
- **Easier Debugging**: Clear error messages help you quickly identify and fix problems
