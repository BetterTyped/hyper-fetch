# Configuration

This guide explains how to configure the Hyper Fetch ESLint plugin to match your project's needs.

---

## Basic Configuration

After [installing the plugin](/documentation/docs/integrations/plugin-eslint/installation.mdx), you have two options for
configuration:

1. ### Using the Recommended Configuration

The recommended configuration enables all rules with their suggested severity levels:

```json
{
  "plugins": [
    // ... your other plugins
    "hyper-fetch"
  ]
}
```

2. ### Manual Configuration

For more control, you can manually configure each rule:

```json
{
  "plugins": [
    // ... your other plugins
    "hyper-fetch"
  ],
  "rules": {
    // ... your other rules
    "hyper-fetch/client-generic-types": "error",
    "hyper-fetch/request-generic-types": "error"
  }
}
```

---

## Rule Severity Levels

Each rule can be set to one of these severity levels:

- `"off"` or `0` - Turn the rule off
- `"warn"` or `1` - Turn the rule on as a warning (doesn't affect exit code)
- `"error"` or `2` - Turn the rule on as an error (exit code will be 1)

Example of setting different severity levels:

```json
{
  "plugins": ["hyper-fetch"],
  "rules": {
    "hyper-fetch/client-generic-types": "error",
    "hyper-fetch/request-generic-types": "warn"
  }
}
```

## Next Steps

Now that you've configured the plugin, proceed to the [Rules](/documentation/docs/integrations/plugin-eslint/rules.mdx)
section to learn about the specific rules and what issues they help you identify.
