# Quick Start

This guide will help you set up the Hyper Fetch ESLint plugin in your project.

## Update ESLint Configuration

After installing the plugin, you need to update your ESLint configuration file (`.eslintrc.js`, `.eslintrc.json`, or
equivalent) to use the plugin.

### Recommended Configuration

The simplest way to use the plugin is to extend the recommended configuration:

```json
{
  "extends": [
    // ... your other extends
    "plugin:hyper-fetch/recommended"
  ]
}
```

This will automatically enable all rules with their recommended settings.

### Next Steps

Now that you've installed the plugin, proceed to the
[Configuration](/documentation/docs/integrations/plugin-eslint/configuration.mdx) section to learn about customizing the
plugin settings or read about the available [Rules](/documentation/docs/integrations/plugin-eslint/rules.mdx) to
understand what issues the plugin helps you identify.
