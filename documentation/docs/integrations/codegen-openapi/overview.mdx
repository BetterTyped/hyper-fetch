This guide will walk you through using the Hyper Fetch OpenAPI code generator. This powerful tool automatically creates
type-safe Hyper Fetch clients, requests, and data models directly from your OpenAPI V3 schema. It streamlines the
process of integrating with REST APIs, saving you time and reducing boilerplate code.

:::success Swagger to Hyper Fetch

This tool is a great way to get started with Hyper Fetch. It will generate a client, requests and types from your API.

:::

---

:::tip Purpose

By using the OpenAPI code generator, you can:

1.  **Automatically generate** a ready-to-use Hyper-Fetch client.
2.  **Create typed requests** for all your API endpoints.
3.  **Define data models** based on your OpenAPI schema components.
4.  **Boost productivity** by eliminating manual setup for API integration.

:::

:::caution Supported Version

Please note that the code generator currently supports **OpenAPI V3 schemas only**. Support for other versions is
planned for the future.

## Getting Started

To start using the request generator, all you need is an OpenAPI V3 JSON schema, available either as a local file or a
remote URL. You can run the generator using `npx`:

```bash
npx @hyper-fetch/codegen-openapi --schema https://petstore3.swagger.io/api/v3/openapi.json
```

This command processes the schema and generates a `openapi.client.ts` file in your current directory. This file contains
a pre-configured Hyper Fetch client, typed request functions, and all the necessary TypeScript types for your API.

Here's a snippet of what the generated file looks like:

```typescript
// ... (imports and namespace definitions)

export const client = new Client({ url: "/api/v3" });

// ... (type definitions for schemas)
export type UpdatePetRequestBody = Paths.UpdatePet.RequestBody;
export type UpdatePetResponseType = Paths.UpdatePet.Responses.$200;

export type AddPetRequestBody = Paths.AddPet.RequestBody;
export type AddPetResponseType = Paths.AddPet.Responses.$200;

// ... (request definitions)

export const updatePet = client.createRequest<UpdatePetResponseType, UpdatePetRequestBody>()({
  method: "PUT",
  endpoint: "/pet",
});

export const addPet = client.createRequest<AddPetResponseType, AddPetRequestBody>()({
  method: "POST",
  endpoint: "/pet",
});
```

### Naming Convention

The generator follows a consistent naming convention based on the `operationId` from your OpenAPI schema:

- **Request Function**: The function name is the camel-cased `operationId`. For example, `addPet`.
- **Type Definitions**: Types are named by combining the pascal-cased `operationId` with a suffix indicating the type of
  data (`ResponseType`, `RequestBody`, `QueryParams`, etc.). For example, `AddPetResponseType` or `AddPetRequestBody`.

## Configuration

You can customize the generator's output with several command-line options.

### Output File Name

By default, the output file is named `openapi.client.ts`. You can specify a different name using the `--name` option:

```bash
npx @hyper-fetch/codegen-openapi --schema <path-to-schema> --name hyper-fetch.requests.ts
```

### Base URL

The generator attempts to extract the base URL from the `servers` field in your OpenAPI schema:

```json
"servers": [
  {
    "url": "/api/v3"
  }
]
```

If you need to override this or if the `servers` field is not present, you can provide a base URL with the `--url`
option:

```bash
npx @hyper-fetch/codegen-openapi --schema <path-to-schema> --url https://api.example.com
```

This will configure the generated client with the specified URL:

```typescript
// ... generated file
export const client = new Client({ url: "https://api.example.com" });
```
