<PackageDetails pkg="@hyper-fetch/axios" />

> Hyper Fetch `axios` adapter is a simple integration that allows Hyper Fetch users to utilize a lot of features of the
> `axios` library along with all the features available in Hyper Fetch.

## Getting Started

In order to set `axios` adapter, you have to import it from the `@hyper-fetch/axios` package:

```tsx
import { Client } from "@hyper-fetch/core";
import { axiosAdapter } from "@hyper-fetch/axios";

const client = new Client({ url: "base-url" }).setAdapter(axiosAdapter);
```

...and voila! It's done. Now you can set all the axios options, either during the request initialization or via
`setOptions` method:

```tsx
const client = new Client({ url: "base-url" }).setAdapter(axiosAdapter);
const request = client.createRequest()({
  endpoint: "/shared-endpoint",
  options: {}, // here
});

const requestWithOptions = request.setOptions({}); // or here
```

## Differences

1. You should not pass the `baseUrl`, `method`, and `url` in the axios options. They will be overwritten by the Hyper
   Fetch adapter.
