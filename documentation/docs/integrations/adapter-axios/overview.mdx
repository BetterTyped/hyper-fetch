[Read the API Reference Â»](/docs/api/adapter-axios/Variables/AxiosAdapter.mdx)

Hyper Fetch's `axios` adapter is a simple integration that allows you to use the popular `axios` HTTP client for making
requests, while still benefiting from all of Hyper Fetch's features like caching, persistence, and request management.

Using the `axios` adapter gives you the best of both worlds.

---

:::tip Purpose

1.  **Leverage `axios`**: Use familiar `axios` options, headers, and error handling.
2.  **Seamless Integration**: Combines `axios` with Hyper Fetch's caching, queuing, and persistence.
3.  **Track Progress**: Get detailed upload and download progress events.
4.  **Full Control**: Access `axios` response details and error objects when needed.

## Getting Started

To use the `axios` adapter:

1. Install the package:

```bash npm2yarn2pnpm
npm install @hyper-fetch/axios
```

2. Import it and set it on your `Client` instance:

(@import adapter-axios AxiosAdapter type=import)

```tsx
import { Client } from "@hyper-fetch/core";
import { axiosAdapter } from "@hyper-fetch/axios";

const client = new Client({ url: "base-url" }).setAdapter(axiosAdapter);
```

3. ...and voila! It's done. Now you can set `axios` options on your requests.

---

## Usage

You can pass any valid `axios` request configuration options to your Hyper Fetch requests. These options can be set when
you create a request or when you send it.

Here's an example of how to use some common `axios` options:

```tsx
import { client } from "./client";

// Create a request with axios-specific options
const getUsers = client.createRequest()({
  endpoint: "/users",
  options: {
    // highlight-start
    // Set a 5-second timeout for the request
    timeout: 5000,
    // Add authentication credentials
    auth: {
      username: "your-username",
      password: "your-password",
    },
    // highlight-end
  },
});
```

Or use the `setOptions` method:

```ts
import { client } from "./client";

const getUsers = client
  .createRequest()({
    endpoint: "/users",
  })
  .setOptions({
    // highlight-start
    // Set a 5-second timeout for the request
    timeout: 5000,
    // Add authentication credentials
    auth: {
      username: "your-username",
      password: "your-password",
    },
    // highlight-end
  });
```

:::caution Key Differences

While you can use most `axios` options, some are managed by Hyper Fetch to ensure proper integration. You should **not**
pass the following options, as they will be overwritten by the adapter:

- `url`
- `baseURL`
- `method`
- `data` (use `payload` in `send` method instead)
- `onUploadProgress` (use `onUploadProgress` in `send` method instead)
- `onDownloadProgress` (use `onDownloadProgress` in `send` method instead)
- `signal` (managed by Hyper Fetch for cancellation)
