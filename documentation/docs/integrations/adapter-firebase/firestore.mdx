# Working with Firestore

This guide will walk you through using the Hyper-Fetch Firestore adapter to interact with your Firestore database.
You'll learn how to perform fundamental data operations like creating, reading, updating, and deleting documents.

:::secondary What you'll learn

1.  **CRUD Operations**: How to use methods like `getDocs`, `getDoc`, `setDoc`, `addDoc`, and `deleteDoc`.
2.  **Realtime Updates**: Understand the separation of standard requests and realtime listeners.
3.  **Handling Data**: How to work with the data and `extra` metadata returned from Firestore.

:::

The Firestore adapter maps familiar Firestore SDK methods to Hyper-Fetch requests. Here's a quick overview of the
available methods:

```tsx
const getReq = client.createRequest<Tea[]>()({
  endpoint: "teas",
  method: "getDocs", // "addDoc" | "getDoc" | "getDocs" | "setDoc" | "updateDoc" | "deleteDoc"
});
```

For the `onSnapshot`-like usage, please check how to
**[listen to queries](/docs/integrations/adapter-firebase/realtime-queries)**.

---

## Methods

All examples are based on this `Tea` type:

```ts
type Tea = {
  __key?: string; // This is how hyper-fetch returns the document id
  origin: string;
  type: string;
  year: number;
  name: string;
  amount: number;
};
```

---

### `getDocs`

Fetches all documents from a collection.

```tsx
const getReq = client.createRequest<Tea[]>()({
  endpoint: "teas",
  method: "getDocs",
});

const { data } = await getReq.send();
// data: Array of document data. Each object includes a `__key` property with the document ID.
```

**Extra values:**

- `ref`: The `CollectionReference` used for the query.
- `snapshot`: The raw `QuerySnapshot` from Firestore.

---

### `getDoc`

Fetches a single document by its ID.

```tsx
const req = client
  .createRequest<Tea>()({
    endpoint: "teas/:teaId",
    method: "getDoc",
  })
  .setParams({ teaId: "some-id-1" });

const { data } = await req.send();
// data: The document data, or `null` if it doesn't exist.
```

**Extra values:**

- `ref`: The `DocumentReference` for the requested document.
- `snapshot`: The raw `DocumentSnapshot` from Firestore.

---

### `setDoc`

Creates or overwrites a single document. To merge data with an existing document, you can pass `{ merge: true }` in the
request options.

```tsx
const newData = { origin: "Poland", type: "Green", year: 2023, name: "Pou Ran Do Cha", amount: 10 };
const setReq = client
  .createRequest<Tea, Tea>()({
    endpoint: "teas/:teaId",
    method: "setDoc",
    // options: { merge: true } // Use to merge data with an existing document
  })
  .setParams({ teaId: "some-id-1" })
  .setData(newData);

const { data } = await setReq.send();
// data: The same data that was sent in the request.
```

---

### `addDoc`

Adds a new document to a collection with a randomly generated ID.

```tsx
const newData = { origin: "China", type: "Oolong", year: 2022, name: "Tie Guan Yin", amount: 50 };
const addDocReq = client
  .createRequest<Tea, Tea>()({
    endpoint: "teas",
    method: "addDoc",
  })
  .setData(newData);

const { data } = await addDocReq.send();
// data: The sent data, with the addition of a `__key` property containing the new document ID.
```

---

### `deleteDoc`

Deletes a single document.

```tsx
const deleteDocReq = client
  .createRequest<null>()({
    endpoint: "teas/:teaId",
    method: "deleteDoc",
  })
  .setParams({ teaId: "some-id-1" });

const { data } = await deleteDocReq.send();
// data: null
```
