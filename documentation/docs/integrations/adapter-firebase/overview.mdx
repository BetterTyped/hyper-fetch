[Read the API Reference Â»](/api/adapter-firebase/Functions/FirebaseAdapter.mdx)

Hyper Fetch's Firebase adapters provide seamless integration with both Firebase Realtime Database and Firestore. This
allows you to use the power and convenience of Hyper-fetch with your Firebase backend, for both web and admin
environments, with a unified and consistent API.

---

:::tip Purpose

1.  **Unified API**: Provides a single interface for both `Realtime Database` and `Firestore`.
2.  **Isomorphic**: Supports both client-side (web) and server-side (admin) Firebase applications.
3.  **Real-time Data**: Includes socket adapters for real-time data listeners.
4.  **Standardized Queries**: Simplifies filtering and querying with a consistent constraint-based syntax.
5.  **Simplified Data Handling**: Automatically handles Firebase-specific data structures, returning clean arrays.

## Choosing the Right Package

Hyper-fetch offers two distinct packages for Firebase integration, tailored to different environments. Your choice
depends on whether you are working in a client-side web application or a server-side admin environment.

### Web Applications (`@hyper-fetch/firebase`)

Use this package for client-side applications running in the browser.

- **`firebaseAdapter`**: For standard database operations (get, set, update).
- **`firebaseSocketsAdapter`**: For setting up real-time listeners to your database.

### Server-side / Admin Environments (`@hyper-fetch/firebase-admin`)

Use this package for backend applications using the Firebase Admin SDK.

- **`firebaseAdminAdapter`**: For standard database operations.
- **`firebaseSocketsAdminAdapter`**: For real-time listeners on the server.

---

## Client Setup

Once you've chosen the right package, you need to initialize Firebase and configure the Hyper-fetch `Client`. The
process is similar for both web and admin environments, with the main difference being the package import and Firebase
initialization.

Here's an example of setting up the client for a **web application**:

```tsx
import { Client } from "@hyper-fetch/core";
import { firebaseAdapter } from "@hyper-fetch/firebase";
import { initializeApp } from "firebase/app";
import { getFirestore } from "firebase/firestore";

// 1. Initialize Firebase
const app = initializeApp({
  projectId: "demo-test-firestore",
});
const db = getFirestore(app);

// 2. Create a Hyper-fetch client with the Firebase adapter
const client = new Client({ url: "teas/" }).setAdapter(() => firebaseAdapter(db));

// 3. Create a request
const getTeas = client.createRequest<{ response Tea[] }>()({
  endpoint: "",
  method: "getDocs",
});

// 4. Send the request and check the results
const { data, status, extra, success, error } = await getTeas.send();
```

For a **server-side application**, you would import from `@hyper-fetch/firebase-admin` and use the Firebase Admin SDK
for initialization. The Hyper-fetch logic for creating requests and handling responses remains the same.

### Response Object

The response from a Firebase request includes:

- `data`: The data from the database. Each document is enhanced with a `__key` property representing its ID.
- `status`: A status of `success`, `error`, or `emptyResource` (if the request was successful but returned no data).
- `success`: A boolean indicating if the request was successful.
- `error`: An error object if the request failed.
- `extra`: Additional properties, such as the `ref` and `snapshot` from Firestore for a `getDocs` method.

---

## Querying Data

The Firebase adapters provide a standardized way to filter and limit your queries using the `constraints` query
parameter. This approach ensures a consistent API across Realtime Database and Firestore, for both web and admin
versions.

You can build complex queries by passing an array of constraints.

```tsx
import { $limit, $orderBy, $where } from "@hyper-fetch/firebase"; // or @hyper-fetch/firebase-admin

const getTeas = client.createRequest<{ response Tea[] }>()({
  endpoint: "",
  method: "getDocs",
});

const { data } = await getTeas.send({
  queryParams: {
    constraints: [$where("type", "==", "Green"), $orderBy("year"), $limit(1)],
  },
});
```

:::info Available Constraints

The adapter provides wrappers for most of Firebase's query methods:

- **Filtering**: `$where`, `$startAt`, `$startAfter`, `$endAt`, `$endAfter`, `$equalTo`
- **Ordering**: `$orderBy`, `$orderByChild`, `$orderByKey`, `$orderByValue`
- **Limiting**: `$limit`, `$limitToFirst`, `$limitToLast`

These functions work just like their native Firebase counterparts.

## Data Handling

The Firebase adapters include logic to simplify data handling, particularly with array-like structures in the Realtime
Database.

:::note Automatic Array Conversion

In Firebase Realtime Database, if you store an array and then remove items, it may no longer be sequential. For example,
deleting elements `a` and `b` from `[a, b, c, d, e]` might result in Firebase returning an object like
`{2: 'c', 4: 'e'}` instead of an array.

Hyper-fetch automatically converts such objects back into an array. Each item in the resulting array will have a `__key`
property containing its original key from the database. This ensures you always work with predictable array structures.
