## Listening to queries - realtime updates

Depending on the product, firebase offers two realtime methods:

- `onValue` for Realtime Database
- `onSnapshot` for Firestore

In Hyper Fetch, in order to make use of these two methods, we have to use our `hyper-fetch/sockets` package.

```tsx
import {Socket} from "@hyper-fetch/sockets";
import {firebaseSocketsAdapter} from "@hyper-fetch/firebase";

const firestoreWebDatabase = <initializedFirestoreDatabase>
const socket = new Socket({ url: "teas/", adapter: firebaseSocketsAdapter(firestoreWebDatabase) });
const onSnapshotRequest = socket.createListener<Tea[]>()({
  name: "",
  options: { groupByChangeType: true },
});
const unmount = await onValueReq.listen({ callback: ({data, extra} => {
  // do something with data and extra received each time socket gets new data
})});
```

As you can see in the presented example:

1. First we need to initialize the socket itself. Here we need to pass an adapter:
   - `firebaseSocketsAdapter` - for web version of Realtime Database and Firestore - from the `@hyper-fetch/firebase`
     package.
   - `firebaseSocketsAdminAdapter` - for admin version of both databases - from the `@hyper-fetch/-firebase-admin`
     package.

The adapter accepts initialized database.

2. We need to create a `listener` - here we can pass the additional options, params, etc.

3. We need to actually listen on the request and provide a callback that will fire each time new data arrives. In case
   of our firebase adapter, callback can access two params:

- `data` - all the received elements.
- `extra` - additional data:
  - `ref` - firebase reference to a path
  - `snapshot` - firebase raw snapshot
  - `status` - status indicating whether a query succeeded or failed

Listener initialization returns an `unmount` function that allows for closing the channel.

## Additional options

Right now we have only one option for each database type:

### Firestore

1. `groupByChangeType` - if we add this option, the `extra` object will have additional object named `groupedResult`

```tsx
const { added, modified, removed } = extra.groupedResult;
```

Let's suppose we are listening on the `teas/` endpoint. Initially, we receive objects. Then, after some time, a new
element is added to the list. In the `data` object we receive all the existing elements - 11. However, the new element
will be also available via `extra.groupedResult.added` list. The same goes for modification of existing elements. All
changes are reflected in `added`, `modified`, and `removed`.

### Realtime

1. `onlyOnce` - if we add this option, listener will query for data only once.

## Filtering realtime queries

You can filter realtime queries exactly in the same way as with 'standard' methods. The example below contains a
listener that will return data only for the object with `type` that equals `Green`:

```tsx
// Should listen for changes only for Green teas
const onSnapshotReq = socket.createListener<Tea[]>()({
  name: "",
  options: { constraints: [$where("type", "==", "Green")] },
});
```
