To make mutations you need a query schema and a client set up with our GraphQL adapter.

## Getting Started

```tsx
import { graphqlAdapter } from "@hyper-fetch/graphql";

// Initialize Client with adapter
const client = new Client({ url: "http://localhost:3000/grahql" }).setAdapter(graphqlAdapter);

type Variables = {
  username: string;
  password: string;
};

// It's ready to use!
const login = client.createRequest<boolean, Variables>()({
  endpoint: gql`
    mutation Login($username: String!, $password: String!) {
      login(username: $username, password: $password) {
        username
        password
      }
    }
  `,
});

const { data, status, extra, success, error } = await getUser
  .setData({
    username: "Some username",
    password: "Some password",
  })
  .send();
```
