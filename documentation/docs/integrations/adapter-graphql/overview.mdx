> The Hyper Fetch GraphQL Adapter provides a seamless way to integrate GraphQL with Hyper Fetch, enabling you to make
> queries and mutations with ease.

:::tip Purpose

1. **Simplify GraphQL integration** in both server and browser environments.
2. **Provide a type-safe way** to handle GraphQL operations.
3. **Offer seamless integration** with the Hyper Fetch ecosystem.
4. **Support both queries and mutations** with a consistent API.

## Installation

To get started, you need to install the `@hyper-fetch/graphql` package. You will also need `graphql` and `graphql-tag`
which are peer dependencies.

```bash
npm install @hyper-fetch/graphql graphql graphql-tag
```

---

## Getting Started

Whether you're developing a server-side GraphQL API or a client-side application that consumes GraphQL data, you can use
Hyper Fetch GraphQL to interact with it. The setup process is simple and straightforward.

```tsx
import { Client } from "@hyper-fetch/core";
import { graphqlAdapter } from "@hyper-fetch/graphql";
import gql from "graphql-tag";

// 1. Create a client
const client = new Client({ url: "http://localhost:3000/graphql" }).setAdapter(graphqlAdapter);

// 2. Define an interface for your data
interface User {
  username: {
    username: string;
    firstName: string;
  };
}

// 3. Create a request
const getUser = client.createRequest<User>()({
  endpoint: gql`
    query GetUser {
      user {
        username
        firstName
      }
    }
  `,
});

// 4. Send the request and get the response
const { data, error } = await getUser.send();
```

## Queries

To perform a query, create a request with the `gql` tag and your GraphQL query string.

```ts
import { Client } from "@hyper-fetch/core";
import { graphqlAdapter } from "@hyper-fetch/graphql";
import gql from "graphql-tag";

const client = new Client({ url: "http://localhost:3000/graphql" }).setAdapter(graphqlAdapter);

const getUsers = client.createRequest<any[]>()({
  endpoint: gql`
    query GetUsers {
      users {
        id
        name
      }
    }
  `,
});
```

---

## Mutations

Mutations work just like queries. Define your mutation string and use it in a request.

```ts
import { Client } from "@hyper-fetch/core";
import { graphqlAdapter } from "@hyper-fetch/graphql";
import gql from "graphql-tag";

const client = new Client({ url: "http://localhost:3000/graphql" }).setAdapter(graphqlAdapter);

const addUser = client.createRequest<any>()({
  endpoint: gql`
    mutation AddUser($name: String!) {
      addUser(name: $name) {
        id
        name
      }
    }
  `,
});
```

---

## Variables

You can pass variables to your queries and mutations using the `data` option in the `send` method.

```ts
const { data, error } = await addUser.send({
  data: {
    variables: { name: "John Doe" },
  },
});
```

This will pass the `name` variable to the `AddUser` mutation.
