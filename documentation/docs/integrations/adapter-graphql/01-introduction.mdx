> Hyper Fetch GraphQL is a powerful adapter designed to seamlessly handle GraphQL requests in both server and browser
> environments. Built with efficiency and ease-of-use in mind, to simplify process of integration.

## Getting Started

Whether you're developing a server-side GraphQL API or a client-side application that consumes GraphQL data, you can use
Hyper Fetch GraphQL to interact with it. Process of setting up the adapter is very simple and straightforward.

```tsx
import { graphqlAdapter } from "@hyper-fetch/graphql";

// Initialize Client with adapter
const client = new Client({ url: "http://localhost:3000/grahql" }).setAdapter(graphqlAdapter);

// It's ready to use!
const getUser = client.createRequest<User>()({
  endpoint: gql`
    query GetUser {
      username {
        username
        firstName
      }
    }
  `,
});

const { data, status, extra, success, error } = await getUser.send();
```
