## Introduction

**`Request Mocking`** is a feature that allows for stubbing/mocking the response for a given endpoint,
 **keeping the complete request lifecycle and events**.

---

## Initialization

You can mock the response via the `request.setMock` method:

```tsx
const mockedRequest = request.setMock({ data: { test: 1, array: [200, 300, 404] } });
```

This way, the `mockedRequest` will always return the `data` with value `{ test: 1, array: [200, 300, 404] } }`.
The `setMock` method accepts an object with the following keys:
- `data` - data to be returned from request
- `status` -  Sets the response status. This can be a number or a string; the default is `**200**`.
- `success` - Informs if the request should be successful or not; the default is `**true**`.
- `config` - Sets additional parameters that tweak the mock even further.
---


## Config

The `setMock` method accepts the `config` object, which allows for tweaking our response.

```tsx
    const request = client
      .createRequest()({ endpoint: "shared-base-endpoint" })
      .setMock({
        data: {mocking: 'is fun'},
        status: 200,
        config: {
          requestTime: 40,
          responseTime: 60,
          totalUploaded: 1000,
          totalDownloaded: 1000,
        },
      });

```
- `timeout` - **boolean** - Indicates whether it should return a timeout error.
`requestTime` - Indicates how long the request to the server should take (in milliseconds).
`responseTime` - Indicates how long the response from the server should take (in milliseconds).
- `totalUploaded` - The total number of kilobytes to be uploaded.
- `totalDownloaded` - The total number of kilobytes to be downloaded.

In the example above, the request phase will take 40 milliseconds. During this phase, 1,000 'kilobytes' will be uploaded and `onUploadProgress` events will be emitted.

The response phase will take 60 milliseconds During this phase, 1,000 'kilobytes' will be downloaded and `onDownloadProgress` events will be emitted.

Note: The word 'kilobytes' is written in quotation marks as no real data exchange occurs â€“ it simply simulates events and allows for data stream mocking.

## Usage and use cases

The mocker can be used in a few ways.
1. It can accept an object:
```tsx
const mockedRequest = request.setMock({ data: { test: 1, array: [200, 300, 404] } });  // Always returns data: { test: 1, array: [200, 300, 404]
```
2. It can accept an array of values. In this case, values will be iterated over cyclically and applied each time a request is executed:

```tsx
  request.setMock([
    { data: { data: [1, 2, 3] }, config: { status: 400, success: false } },
    { data: { data: [1, 2, 3] }, config: { status: 200 } },
  ]);

await request.send() // returns  { data: { data: [1, 2, 3] }, config: { status: 400, success: false } }
await request.send() // returns  { data: { data: [1, 2, 3] }, config: { status: 200 } }
await request.send() // returns  { data: { data: [1, 2, 3] }, config: { status: 400, success: false } }
```
3. It also accepts methods that have access to the `request` itself. This allows for dynamic mocking, dependent on the passed arguments during execution:
```tsx
    const mockedRequest = client
      .createRequest()({ endpoint: "/users/:id" })
      .setMock((r) => {
        const { params } = r;
        if (params.id === 11) {
          return { data: [1, 2, 3], config: { status: 222 } };
        }
        return { data: [4, 5, 6] };
      });
```
4. The passed method may be asynchronous:
```tsx
    const mockedRequest = client
      .createRequest<Record<string, any>>()({ endpoint: "users/:id" })
      .setMock(async (r) => {
        if (r?.params?.id === 1) {
          return { data: [1, 2, 3], config: { status: 222 } };
        }
        return { data: [4, 5, 6] };
      });
```
You can also pass a list of functions; the mocker will cycle over them and execute the correct one each time a request is executed.

## Removal

If you need to remove the mocker from a request, use the `removeMock` method. This way mocker is disabled and mock data is removed.
```tsx
mockedRequest.removeMock();
```


## Disabling single mocker

Instead of removing mocker, you can also disable mocker and enable mocker at will with the `request.setEnableMocking` method.
This way if you set mocking data, it will be kept and not removed as in the `removeMock` case.

```tsx
const mockedRequest = request.setMock({ data: fixture }); // mock is set
... // Here mocker works as usual
mockedRequest.setEnableMocking(false); // Mocker is disabled
... // Request works as usual
mockedRequest.setEnableMocking(true); // Mocker is enabled once again
```

## Disabling mocking for all requests

If you want to disable mocking for all requests of a given `client` instance - you can use the `client.setEnableMocking` method.
This way all related requests will behave 'as usual' and setting/enabling mocks on single requests will not have any effect.

```tsx
const client = new Client(...);
const mockedRequest_1 = newClient.createRequest()({ ... }).setMock({ data: fixture1 });
const mockedRequest_2 = newClient.createRequest()({ ... }).setMock({ data: fixture2 });
... // Here mocked requests return mocked data.
client.setEnableMocking(false) // All mocks are disabled
... // Here requests work as usual
client.setEnableMocking(true) // All mocks are enabled once again
```
