## Introduction

**`Request Mocking`** is a feature that allows for stubbing/mocking the response for a given endpoint,
 **keeping the complete request lifecycle and events**.

---

## Initialization

You can mock the response via the `request.setMock` method:

```tsx
const mockedRequest = request.setMock({ data: { test: 1, array: [200, 300, 404] } });
```

This way, the `mockedRequest` will always return the `data` with value `{ test: 1, array: [200, 300, 404] } }`.
The `setMock` method accepts an object with the following keys:
- `data` - data to be returned from request
- `status` -  Sets the response status. This can be a number or a string; the default is `**200**`.
- `success` - Informs if the request should be successful or not; the default is `**true**`.
- `config` - Sets additional parameters that tweak the mock even further.
---


## Config

The `setMock` method accepts the `config` object, which allows for tweaking our response.

```tsx
    const request = client
      .createRequest()({ endpoint: "shared-base-endpoint" })
      .setMock({
        data: {mocking: 'is fun'},
        status: 200,
        config: {
          requestTime: 40,
          responseTime: 60,
          totalUploaded: 1000,
          totalDownloaded: 1000,
        },
      });

```
- `timeout` - **boolean** - informs whether it should return a timeout error.
 - `requestTime` - Simulates how long the request to the server should take (in milliseconds).
 - `responseTime` - Indicates how long the response from the server should take (in milliseconds).
If their combined total takes longer than provided timeout, each value will be automatically adjusted to last half of the timeout time.
- `totalUploaded` - total number of 'kilobytes' to be uploaded.
- `totalDownloaded` - total number of 'kilobytes' to be downloaded.

In the example above - the request phase will take 40 milliseconds and during this phase 1000 'kilobytes' will be uploaded (and `onUploadProgress` events will be emitted).
The response phase will take 60 millisecond and during this phase 1000 'kilobytes' will be downloaded (and `onDownloadProgress` events will be emitted).
The word `kilobytes` is written in quotation marks as no real data exchange occurs - it is simply to mock events and allow for data stream mocking.


## Usage and use cases

The mocker can be used in a few ways.
1. It can accept an object:
```tsx
const mockedRequest = request.setMock({ data: { test: 1, array: [200, 300, 404] } });  // Always returns data: { test: 1, array: [200, 300, 404]
```
2. It can accept an array of values. In this case, values will be iterated over cyclically and applied each time a request is executed:

```tsx
  request.setMock([
    { data: { data: [1, 2, 3] }, config: { status: 400, success: false } },
    { data: { data: [1, 2, 3] }, config: { status: 200 } },
  ]);

await request.send() // returns  { data: { data: [1, 2, 3] }, config: { status: 400, success: false } }
await request.send() // returns  { data: { data: [1, 2, 3] }, config: { status: 200 } }
await request.send() // returns  { data: { data: [1, 2, 3] }, config: { status: 400, success: false } }
```
3. It also accepts methods that have access to the `request` itself. This allows for dynamic mocking, dependent on the passed arguments during execution:
```tsx
    const mockedRequest = client
      .createRequest()({ endpoint: "/users/:id" })
      .setMock((r) => {
        const { params } = r;
        if (params.id === 11) {
          return { data: [1, 2, 3], config: { status: 222 } };
        }
        return { data: [4, 5, 6] };
      });
```
4. The passed method may be asynchronous:
```tsx
    const mockedRequest = client
      .createRequest<Record<string, any>>()({ endpoint: "users/:id" })
      .setMock(async (r) => {
        if (r?.params?.id === 1) {
          return { data: [1, 2, 3], config: { status: 222 } };
        }
        return { data: [4, 5, 6] };
      });
```
You can also pass a list of functions; the mocker will cycle over them and execute the correct one each time a request is executed.

## Removal

If you need to remove the mocker from a request, use the `removeMock` method:
```tsx
mockedRequest.removeMock();
```
