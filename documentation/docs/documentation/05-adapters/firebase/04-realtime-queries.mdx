## Listening to queries - realtime updates

Depending on the product, Firebase offers two realtime methods:
  - `onValue` for Realtime Database.
  - `onSnapshot` for Firestore.

To make use of these two methods in Hyper Fetch, we use our `hyper-fetch/sockets` package.

```tsx
import {Socket} from "@hyper-fetch/sockets";
import {firebaseSocketsAdapter} from "@hyper-fetch/firebase";

const firestoreWebDatabase = <initializedFirestoreDatabase>
const socket = new Socket({ url: "teas/", adapter: firebaseSocketsAdapter(firestoreWebDatabase) });
const onSnapshotRequest = socket.createListener<Tea[]>()({
  name: "",
  options: { groupByChangeType: true },
});
const unmount = await onValueReq.listen({ callback: ({data, extra} => {
  // do something with data and extra received each time socket gets new data
})});
```

As you can see in the presented example:
1. First we need to initialize the socket itself with an adapter:
    - `firebaseSocketsAdapter` - for web versions of Realtime Database and Firestore - from the `@hyper-fetch/firebase` package.
    - `firebaseSocketsAdminAdapter` - for the admin version of both databases - from the `@hyper-fetch/-firebase-admin` package.

The adapter accepts initialized database.

2. We need to create a `listener`. There we can pass the additional options, params, etc.

3. We need to actually listen on the request and provide a callback that will fire each time new data arrives. In our Firebase adapter, callback can access two params:
- `data` - all the received elements.
- `extra` - additional data, e.g.:
    - `ref` - A Firebase reference to a path
    - `snapshot` - A Firebase raw snapshot
    - `status` -  Indicates whether a query succeeded or failed.

Listener initialization returns an `unmount` function that allows closing the channel.

## Additional options

Currently, we have only one option for each database type:

### Firestore

For Firestore, we have `groupByChangeType`. If we add this option, the `extra` object will have additional object named `groupedResult`.
```tsx
const {added, modified, removed} = extra.groupedResult
```

Let's suppose we are listening on the `teas/` endpoint. Initially, we receive objects. Then, after some time, a new element is added to the list. In the `data` object, weâ€™ll receive all 11 existing elements.
However, the new element will be also available via the `extra.groupedResult.added` list. The same goes for the modification of existing elements. All changes are reflected in `added`,`modified`, and `removed`.

### Realtime Database

For Realtime Database, we have `onlyOnce`. if we add this option, the listener will query for data only once.

## Filtering realtime queries

You can filter realtime queries in the same way as standard methods.
The example below contains a listener that will return data only for the object with a `type` that equals `Green`:

```tsx
// Should listen for changes only for Green teas
const onSnapshotReq = socket.createListener<Tea[]>()({
  name: "",
  options: { constraints: [$where("type", "==", "Green")] },
});

```
