Hyper Fetch `firebase` packages offer complete integration of `realtime database` and `firestore`, both for frontend and
backend. We offer a single, unified approach for all of them.

## Getting Started

To start using the Firebase adapter, you have to initialize the Firestore/Realtime database and set the correct adapter on the `client`.

There are two packages to chose from with two adapters each:

1. `@hyper-fetch/firebase` - for working with web realtime and firestore databases:
    1. `firebaseAdapter` - for standard REST requests.
    2. `firebaseSocketsAdapter` - for realtime listening.
2. `@hyper-fetch/firebase-admin` - for admin versions of the packages:
    1. `firebaseAdminAdapter` - for standard REST requests.
    2. `firebaseSocketsAdminAdapter` - for realtime listening.

Both packages have the same unified interface.

```tsx
import { firebaseAdapter } from "@hyper-fetch/firebase";
import { initializeApp } from "firebase/app";
import { getFirestore } from "firebase/firestore";

// Firebase firestore database initialization
const app = initializeApp({
  projectId: "demo-test-firestore",
});
const db = getFirestore(app);

// Setting up the HyperFetch with a firebase adapter
const client = new Client({ url: "teas/" }).setAdapter(() => firebaseAdapter(db));
const getReq = client.createRequest<Tea[]>()({
  endpoint: "",
  method: "getDocs",
});

// Checking the results
const { data, status, extra, success, error } = await getReq.send();
```

In case of firebase admin, the only difference is the import:

```tsx
import { firebaseAdminAdapter } from "@hyper-fetch/firebase-admin";
...
```

The resulting `response` is an object that contains the following properties:

1. `data` - The data returned from the database. Each object returned from the database is also enhanced by the `__key` param that equals the id of a given document.
2. `status` - Indicates whether a request ended with `success`, `error`, or `emptyResource`. An `emptyResource`  occurs when the request to the Firebase succeeded but no data was returned.
3. `success` - Indicates if the overall request succeeded (`true`) or failed (`false`).
4. `error` - Contains an error object if the request failed.
5. `extra` - Contains additional properties, depending on the method used. E.g. for the `getDocs` method, this allows access to `ref` and `snapshot` from the Firestore Firebase.

## Differences from 'raw' firebase

1. If we store an array in Firebase (e.g.`[a, b, c]`), the query will return the same array.
However, if the array stops being sequential – if `a` and `b` were deleted from our example – Firebase would return an object.
In this example, it would be `{2: 'c', 4: 'e'}`. Hyper Fetch always returns an array.
Each object in an array has an additional `__key` property, that indicates the id of a given object.

## Filtering queries

In order to standardize the interface across admin, web Firestore, and Realtime database, queries are filtered and limited by setting the `constraints` queryParam:

```tsx
import { $limit, $orderBy, $where } from "constraints";

const req = client.createRequest<Tea[]>()({
  endpoint: "",
  method: "getDocs",
}); // or via setQueryParams method
const { data } = await req.send({
  queryParams: { constraints: [$where("type", "==", "Green"), $orderBy("year"), $limit(1)] },
});
```

Users can pass the array of constraints and filters. Please pay attention to the fact that you need to filter using the method wrappers provided via the `adapter-firebase` package:
- `$where`
- `$orderBy`
- `$limit`
- `$startAt`
- `$startAfter`
- `$endAt`
- `$endAfter`
- `$orderByChild`
- `$orderByKey`
- `$orderByValue`
- `$limitToFirst`
- `$limitToLast`
- `$equalTo`
All of these methods work exactly the same as their Firebase equivalents.
