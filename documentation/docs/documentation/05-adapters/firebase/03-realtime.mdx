## Available Realtime Database Methods

Our Realtime Database adapter provides all the methods available for Realtime Database.
However, due to its nature, we've solved the realtime listening a bit differently. Thus, this method is not allowed in a standard adapter.
For `onValue`-like usage, please see how to **[listen to queries](/docs/documentation/adapters/firebase/realtime-queries)**.

### get

```tsx
import {firebaseAdapter} from "@hyper-fetch/firebase";

const client = new Client({ url: "teas/" }).setAdapter(() => firebaseAdapter(realtimeDbWeb));
 const req = client.createRequest<Tea[]>()({
    endpoint: "",
    method: "get",
  });

const { data, status, extra, success, error } = await req.send();
```

`extra`:
1. `ref` - A reference to the endpoint.
2. `snapshot` - A 'raw' snapshot from the result.

### set

```tsx
const setReq = client
  .createRequest<Tea, Tea>()({
    endpoint: ":teaId",
    method: "set",
  })
  .setParams({ teaId: 1 })
  .setData(newData);

const { data, status, extra, success, error } = await req.send();
```

In `set`, the returned data is the same as the data passed for setting.

`extra`:
1. ref - The database reference to the path.

You can also **remove data** via set by sending the `{data: null}` object:
```tsx
const setReq = client.createRequest<Tea, {data: null}>()({
  endpoint: ":teaId",
  method: "set",
})
.setParams({ teaId: 1 })
.setData({data: null});
```

### push

```tsx
const pushReq = client
  .createRequest<Tea, Tea>()({
    endpoint: "",
    method: "push",
    options: {},
  })
  .setData(newData);
```

In `push`, the returned data is the same as the data passed for setting plus the `__key` param that equals id of a newly created document.

`extra`:
1. ref - The database reference to the path.
2. key - The key of the newly created resource.

### update

```tsx
const updateReq = client
  .createRequest<Tea, Tea>()({
    endpoint: ":teaId",
    method: "update",
  })
  .setData(newData);
```

In `update`, the returned data is the same as the data passed for setting.

`extra`:
1. ref - The database reference to the path.

### remove

```tsx
const removeReq = client
  .createRequest<Tea>()({
    endpoint: ":teaId",
    method: "remove",
  })
  .setParams({ teaId: 1 });
```

In case of `remove` - returned data equals `null`
