Note: Openapi Hyper Fetch code generator is still in beta. Please let us know in case of any problems.

Note: Right now this code generator accepts only V3 version of the openapi schema.

## Getting Started

In order to start using the request generator, you need only one thing: OpenApi V3 JSON schema file or link to it. Then,
you can simply call the package via `npx`:

```tsx
npx @hyper-fetch/codegen-openapi --schema https://petstore3.swagger.io/api/v3/openapi.json
```
