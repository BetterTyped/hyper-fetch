## Introduction

**`useAppManager`** allows you to use information about the connection status and screen focus state. It also offers
options to manipulate its global state. This hook uses the [`AppManager`](/documentation/02-core/managers.mdx) available
on the [`Client`](/documentation/02-core/client.mdx) instance.

It returns the status of `isOnline` and `isFocused` and the actions that allow you to change them.

```tsx
const { isOnline, setOnline } = useAppManager(client);

setOnline(true);
```

```tsx
const { isFocused, setFocused } = useAppManager(client);

setFocused(true);
```

## Returns

Returned values from this hook.

```tsx
const values = useAppManager(client);
```

{@import React useAppManager returns}
