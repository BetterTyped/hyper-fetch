## Structure

1. Structure is critically important, so we'll explain how we approach it in HyperFetch. First of all, we create a
   directory for our `client` and its `requests`. We export the prepared elements from this directory.

2. Next, we create a directory for each entity in our system (i.e. users, todos, categories, products, groups ...) and
   store our requests.

3. During this setup, we maintain maximum re-usability; thanks to the usage of classes and object-oriented approach, we
   can access these elements from anywhere. We can reuse our previously-prepared requests in any component. Also, tests
   have full access without any setup duplication – they use the current settings.

```

## Debugging

You can debug apps in one of two ways:

** 1. Use the built-in logger **

Use the client `setDebug(true)` method for this. It will start logging actions in the console. To adjust what type of
logs will be shown, use `setLoggerSeverity(3)` to get debug logs displayed in the console. Those will show you the exact
data and information flow in the library while working on your application.

** 2. Create your own logger **

You can create your own dev tools based on events sent from the
[requestManager](/documentation/02-core/managers.mdx#requestmanager). There is no limitation, and you can receive all
necessary data to create everything you may need.
