## Introduction

**`Adapter`** is a class that gives us possibility to interact with servers. The default adapter is used to communicate
with the `Websocket` or `SSE` server. However, there is nothing to prevent you from changing this and creating the
adapter you need. Thanks to event communication, you can set your own adapter as you wish by only fulfilling the
typescript requirements. This way you can create your own adapters for existing libraries like `socket.io`.
