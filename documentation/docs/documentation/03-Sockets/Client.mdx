## Introduction

**`Client`** is a class that gives us possibility to interact with servers. The default client is used to communicate
with the `Websocket` or `SSE` server. However, there is nothing to prevent you from changing this and creating the
client you need. Thanks to event communication, you can set your own client as you wish by only fulfilling the
typescript requirements. This way you can create own adapters for existing libraries like `socket.io`.
