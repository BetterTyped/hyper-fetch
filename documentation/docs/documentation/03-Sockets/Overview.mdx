Sockets module was created to handle listeners and emitters on open connections. Our base `Hyper Fetch` package was
created with different approach to things like interceptors or data exchange itself but has some architecture decisions
in common, like singleton pattern.

## Package goal

- Providing neutral standard for data exchange
- Architecture to support composing our logic with existing adapters like socket.io
- Possibility to attach own adapter addapters with ease and flexibility
- Separation of listeners and emitters to clearly split responsibility
- Handle SSE and Websocket with single package
