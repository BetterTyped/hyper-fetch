**Managers** are core subsystems in Hyper Fetch that handle essential app-wide concerns—like network status, request
lifecycle, and logging. They provide powerful, centralized APIs for managing state, events, and behaviors across your
application, making advanced features like offline support, cancellation, and debugging easy to implement and maintain
in other environments like React, Node.js, etc.

The library contains several managers, each supporting a specific subsystem or feature. Understanding these managers
helps you unlock advanced capabilities and build robust, maintainable applications.

## AppManager

[Read the API Reference »](/api/core/Classes/AppManager.mdx)

The **AppManager** detects and manages your application's online/offline state, tracks window focus and blur events, and
allows integration with custom event sources (such as React Native or Electron). It provides unmount callbacks for easy
cleanup, making it simple to handle app-wide lifecycle events in any environment.

:::tip Purpose

1. Track **online/offline** status of the app
2. Detect **window focus** and **blur** events
3. **Allow custom event** sources for different environments

:::

```tsx title="Listening to App Events"
// highlight-start
const unmountFocusListener = client.appManager.events.onFocus(() => {
  console.log("App is focused!");
});
const unmountOfflineListener = client.appManager.events.onOffline(() => {
  console.log("App is offline!");
});
// highlight-end

// ... later, to clean up:
unmountFocusListener();
unmountOfflineListener();
```

:::info

Hyper Fetch event listeners always return unmounting callbacks for easier cleanup handling.

:::

#### Customizing Events

If you're using a non-browser environment (like React Native), you can set custom event handlers:

```ts
client.appManager.setFocusEvents({
  onFocus: myCustomFocusHandler,
  onBlur: myCustomBlurHandler,
});
```

## RequestManager

[Read the API Reference »](/api/core/Classes/RequestManager.mdx)

The **RequestManager** manages cancellation tokens for requests, emits events throughout the request lifecycle
(including start, upload, download, response, and abort), and supports aborting requests by requestId or custom
abortKey. It enables granular progress tracking and advanced cancellation scenarios for robust request handling.

:::tip Purpose

1. Manage cancellation tokens for requests
2. Emit events for request lifecycle (start, upload, download, response, abort)
3. Support aborting by requestId or abortKey

:::

```tsx title="Tracking Upload/Download Progress"
// highlight-start
const unmountUploadListener = client.requestManager.events.onUploadProgressById(requestId, (progress) => {
  console.log("Upload progress:", progress);
});
const unmountDownloadListener = client.requestManager.events.onDownloadProgressById(requestId, (progress) => {
  console.log("Download progress:", progress);
});
// highlight-end

// ... later, to clean up:
unmountUploadListener();
unmountDownloadListener();
```

:::info

You can abort requests by their `requestId` or by a custom `abortKey` to cancel groups of requests at once.

:::

### AbortKey

Every request added to the dispatcher creates an abort controller, stored in a Map under its abort key (usually the
`requestId`). This lets you abort single requests or groups of requests easily.

```tsx
const getUser = client.createRequest()({
  method: "GET",
  endpoint: "/users/:userId",
});

// highlight-start
const abortKey = getUser.abortKey; // "/users/:userId"
const abortKeyWithParams = getUser.setParams({ userId: 1 }).abortKey; // "/users/1"
const abortKeyWithQueryParams = getUser.setQueryParams({ page: 1 }).abortKey; // "/users/:userId"
// highlight-end
```

#### Custom abortKey

You can also set a custom abort key:

```tsx
import { client } from "./api";

const getUser = client.createRequest()({
  method: "GET",
  endpoint: "/users/:userId",
  abortKey: "CUSTOM_ABORT_KEY",
});

// highlight-start
console.log(getUser.abortKey); // "CUSTOM_ABORT_KEY"
// highlight-end
```

#### Generic abortKey

You can also set a generic abort key:

```tsx
import { client } from "./api";

// highlight-start
client.setQueryKeyMapper((request) => {
  if (request.requestOptions.endpoint === "/users/:userId") {
    return `CUSTOM_ABORT_KEY_${request.params?.userId || "unknown"}`;
  }
});
// highlight-end

const getUser = client.createRequest()({
  method: "GET",
  endpoint: "/users/:userId",
});

// highlight-start
console.log(getUser.setParams({ userId: 1 }).queryKey); // "CUSTOM_QUERY_KEY_1"
// highlight-end
```

```ts title=Example
client.requestManager.events.onResponse((response, details) => {
  // Handle response
});
```

## LoggerManager

[Read the API Reference »](/api/core/Classes/LoggerManager.mdx)

The **LoggerManager** centralizes logging for all subsystems, enables creation of custom loggers for different modules
or features, and ensures consistent logging by inheriting parent configuration. It offers flexible log levels and output
formatting to keep logs organized and actionable.

:::tip Purpose

1. Centralize logging for all subsystems
2. Enable creation of custom loggers for modules/features
3. Inherit parent configuration for consistent logging

:::

```ts title="Custom Logger Example"
// highlight-start
const logger = client.loggerManager.init("My Module");
logger.error("Something went wrong!"); // Output: [My Module] Something went wrong!
// highlight-end
```

---

:::info Best Practices

- Always clean up event listeners using the returned unmount callbacks to avoid memory leaks.
- Use custom abort keys for advanced cancellation scenarios (e.g., aborting all requests for a specific feature).
- Leverage custom loggers to keep logs organized and actionable.
