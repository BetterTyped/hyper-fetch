# Data Fetching

> Getting data from APIs is the bread and butter of modern web applications. It's also one of the most tedious and
> error-prone tasks. Reins aims to make it as easy as possible with unlimited integrations possibilities.

## âš¡ Hyper Fetch

We are using our own package for building scalable data-exchange solutions. Starting designing our ecosystem from the
data perspective opened many interesting opportunities for us, which you will learn along this documentation.

## Request definition

The main and most important part of the design is Request definition. We prepare sets of the Requests for later use in
our application. This allows us to have a single source of truth for all the data we are fetching.

```ts
// requests.ts
import { Client } from "@hyper-fetch/core";

const client = new Client({ url: "http://localhost:3000" });

// highlight-start
export const getUser = client.createRequest<User>()({
  url: "/users/:id",
  method: "GET",
});
// highlight-end
```

This `getUser` request can be used in many places in our application. We can use common hooks to fetch data with this
request.

```tsx
import { useFetch } from "@hyper-fetch/react";

import { getUser } from "./requests";

const App = () => {
  // highlight-next-line
  const { data, loading, error } = useFetch(getUser.setParams({ id: 1 }));

  return (
    <div>
      {loading && <div>Loading...</div>}
      {error && <div>Error: {error.message}</div>}
      {data && <div>User: {data.name}</div>}
    </div>
  );
};
```

##### Simple right?
