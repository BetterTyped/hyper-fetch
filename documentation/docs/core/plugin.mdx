Plugins allow you to connect into the lifecycle of the whole library. They expose different sets of the methods allowing
you to react to particular events happening within a system.

:::tip Purpose

1. Persists request side-effects
2. Manipulates the lifecycle and allows hooking in

## How to use?

The best way to create new plugin is to wrap the `Plugin` class into a function. This way you can pass in the
configuration options and return the plugin instance.

```ts title="Creating a new plugin"
import { Plugin } from "@hyper-fetch/core";

const MyPlugin = ({ module }: { module: string }) => {
  // highlight-start
  return new Plugin({
    // Hook into creation of the request and log it
    onRequestCreate: (request) => {
      console.log(`[${module}] Request created`, request);
    },
  });
  // highlight-end
};

const client = new Client({
  url: "https://api.example.com",
  // highlight-start
}).addPlugin(MyPlugin({ module: "MyApp" }));
// highlight-end
```

## Use cases

### Logging

Plugins are heavily used by our devtools system to provide you with the live feed of what is happening in your
application. They are great for logging, tracking, debugging and collecting metrics.

### Persistence

There are many applications which require you to persist the state of the application. After reloading of the browser,
app or server you need to keep up with the unsent requests.

:::note Other solutions

There are many solutions for persistence, all of them approach this problem by introducing the sync mechanisms and local
DBs. Among them you can find:

- [WatermelonDB](https://github.com/Nozbe/WatermelonDB)
- [PouchDB](https://pouchdb.com/)
- [Lowdb](https://github.com/typicode/lowdb)

:::

Hyper Fetch being the fetcher and a server state manager it is able to persist the state of the application. Not only
that - it can store and persist requests which are not triggered yet - for example if you're in the offline mode.

```ts live title="Persisting requests" console
import { getUser } from "./api";

// highlight-next-line
const jsonRequest = getUser.toJSON();

console.log(jsonRequest);
// use JSON.stringify to get the same result
console.log(JSON.stringify(getUser, null, 4));
```

Having the request in the JSON format you can easily persist it in the persistent storage like local storage or any
other storage you want.

Now imagine our app is offline, we close it and open it again. We can see that the request is still in the persistent
storage and we can trigger it again.

```ts live title="Triggering requests" size=md console
import { getUser } from "./api";

const jsonRequest = getUser.toJSON();

// Recreate the request from the JSON
// highlight-next-line
const request = Request.fromJSON(client, jsonRequest);

request.setMock(() => ({
  data: {
    name: "John Doe",
    age: 20,
  },
  status: 200,
}));

// Call the request
const response = await request.send();

console.log(response);
```

We don't have to do it for every request. To do so, we can attach into the Dispatcher lifecycle and on the
`onDispatcherItemAdded` and `onDispatcherItemDeleted` events. With them we can add the stringified requests to the
persistent storage.

Then on the start of the app we can trigger the requests from the persistent storage - this is because after refresh of
the app Dispatchers do not have access to the persisted storage with our requests. At this time we can add the requests
to the Dispatcher and trigger them or wait a bit waiting for the app to load.

```ts live title="Triggering requests" size=md console
// Create a plugin to persist the requests
const PersistPlugin = () => {
  return new Plugin()
    .onDispatcherItemAdded(({ queueItem }) => {
      localStorage.setItem(queueItem.requestId, JSON.stringify(queueItem.request.toJSON()));
    })
    .onDispatcherItemDeleted(({ queueItem }) => {
      localStorage.removeItem(queueItem.requestId);
    })
    .onMount(() => {
      // Trigger the requests from the persistent storage or reload
      const requests = Object.values(localStorage).map((request) => Request.fromJSON(client, JSON.parse(request)));
      if (requests.length > 0) {
        requests.forEach((request) => {
          request.send();
        });
      }
    });
};

// Add the plugin to the client
client.addPlugin(PersistPlugin());
```

That's it! It is very simple concept, so keep that in mind when you're building your app.

We are waiting for your feedback on this feature. If you have any ideas or suggestions, please let us know. We are very
determined to make it better and more useful for you.

:::

There are few more aspects that could be worth mentioning like:

1. **Optimistic approach** when you want to reflect all of the changes from your persisting requests inside of your UI.

2. Topic of the **connectivity** itself. Your backend need to track all of the persistent requests with some kind of
   identifier from the frontend - possibly passed with a Header or a Query Parameter. **To prevent duplicates and
   conflicts**, you need to have some kind of a logic to prevent them.

These are large topics deserving their own guides, so stay tuned!
