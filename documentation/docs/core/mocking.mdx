[Read the API Reference Â»](/api/core/Classes/Request.mdx#setmock)

Mocking is a built-in feature of [Request](/docs/core/request). It is a feature that allows for mock the response for a
given endpoint at the same time keeping the **complete request lifecycle** and events. Thanks to the design of the
library, we can also micro-manage things like upload/download progresses, timings, trigger all kinds of errors for
amazing developer experience. It is a great way to test your code in isolation, without relying on external services and
keeping the **full type safety** of your code.

---

:::tip Purpose

1. Control upload/download progress and timings
2. Simulate errors and timeouts
3. Test edge cases and custom scenarios
4. Keep your tests fast, reliable, and independent

## How it works?

To add a mock to a request, we need to use the `setMock(mockFn, config)` method. It accepts a function that returns a
mock response. With this simple concept you're able to introduce any mocking approach of your choice.

:::warning Reference change

Method `setMock()` is the only method modifying the Request reference.

This will allow us to mock every request in given group.

:::

```tsx live
const getNotes = client.createRequest()({
  endpoint: "/notes",
});

getNotes.setMock(
  // Our mock function
  ({ request, requestId }) => {
    return {
      data: {
        items: [{ text: "This is mocked note" }],
      },
    };
  },
  // Config
  {
    responseTime: 500,
    requestTime: 500,
    totalUploaded: 1000,
    totalDownloaded: 1000,
  },
);

const response = await getNotes.send();
console.log(response);
```

## Options

What you return from the mocker is used to generate the output and behavior of the mocker.

### Response

The base API requires you to return the response for the mocked request. This part defines how our data will look like.

(@import core MockResponseType type=returns&display=table)

### Config

There is also additional config which can specify behavioral aspect of the mocker. How long it should be processed,
should it throw timeout error or how much of a data we want to mock for the transfer updates.

(@import core MockerConfigType type=returns&display=table)

```tsx
const request = client
  .createRequest()({ endpoint: "shared-base-endpoint" })
  .setMock(
    () => {
      // Data part
      return {
        data: { mocking: "is fun" },
        status: 200,
      };
    },
    {
      // Config part
      requestTime: 40,
      responseTime: 60,
      totalUploaded: 1000,
      totalDownloaded: 1000,
    },
  );
```

In the example above - the request phase will take 40 milliseconds and during this phase 1000 'bytes' will be "uploaded"
(and `onUploadProgress` events will be emitted). The response phase will take 60 millisecond and during this phase 1000
'bytes' will be "downloaded" (and `onDownloadProgress` events will be emitted). In fact no data-exchange occurs, but we
will make sure to simulate it for you.

## Usage and use cases

#### Request context

The mocker is now used by passing a callback function to `setMock`. This function receives the request context and
returns the mock response. This allows for dynamic mocking, dependent on the passed arguments during execution.

```tsx
const mockedRequest = client
  .createRequest()({ endpoint: "/users/:id" })
  .setMock(({ request }) => {
    const { params } = request;
    if (params.id === 11) {
      return { data: [1, 2, 3], config: { status: 222 } };
    }
    return { data: [4, 5, 6], status: 200 };
  });
```

The passed method may also be asynchronous:

```tsx
const mockedRequest = client
  .createRequest<{ response: Record<string, any> }>()({ endpoint: "users/:id" })
  .setMock(async (request) => {
    // Do some asynchronous processing of the payload
    const myData = await processPayload(request.payload);

    return { data: myData, status: 200 };
  });
```

> **Note:** Only the callback function form is supported. Passing objects, arrays, or lists of functions is no longer
> available.

#### Canceling

Canceling a request works the same way as in the real request. It will throw an error and the request will be canceled.

```tsx live
const request = client.createRequest()({
  endpoint: "some-endpoint",
});

request.setMock(
  () => {
    return {
      data: { mocking: "is fun" },
      status: 200,
    };
  },
  {
    requestTime: 1000,
    responseTime: 1000,
  },
);

const response = request.send();

setTimeout(() => {
  request.abort();
}, 1000);
```

#### Timeout

You can simulate timeout error by setting `timeout` to `true` in the config.

```tsx live
const request = client.createRequest()({
  endpoint: "shared-base-endpoint",
});

request.setMock(
  () => {
    return {
      data: { mocking: "is fun" },
      status: 200,
    };
  },
  {
    // It will take 2s to be processed
    requestTime: 2000,
    responseTime: 2000,
    totalUploaded: 1000,
    totalDownloaded: 1000,
    // Timeout error will be thrown after 1s
    timeout: 2000,
  },
);

const response = await request.send();
console.log(response);
```

## Mocking state

Apart from adding a mock to a request, you can also remove it or disable it.

### How to remove mocker?

If you need to remove the mocker from a request, use the `clearMock()` method. This way mocker is disabled and mock data
is removed.

```tsx
request.clearMock();
```

### Disabling single mocker

Instead of removing mocker, you can also disable mocker and enable mocker at will with the `request.setMockingEnabled`
method. This way if you set mocking data, it will be kept and not removed as in the `clearMock` case.

```tsx
const mockedRequest = request.setMock({ data: fixture }); // mock is set
... // Here mocker works as usual
mockedRequest.setMockingEnabled(false); // Mocker is disabled
... // Request works as usual
mockedRequest.setMockingEnabled(true); // Mocker is enabled once again
```

### Disabling mocking for all requests

If you want to disable mocking for all requests of a given `client` instance - you can use the
`client.setMockingEnabled` method. This way all related requests will behave 'as usual' and setting/enabling mocks on
single requests will not have any effect.

```tsx
const client = new Client(...);
const mockedRequest_1 = newClient.createRequest()({ ... }).setMock({ data: fixture1 });
const mockedRequest_2 = newClient.createRequest()({ ... }).setMock({ data: fixture2 });
... // Here mocked requests return mocked data.
client.setMockingEnabled(false) // All mocks are disabled
... // Here requests work as usual
client.setMockingEnabled(true) // All mocks are enabled once again
```
