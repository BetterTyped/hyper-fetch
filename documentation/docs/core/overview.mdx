> _`Hyper Fetch`_ is an ambitious approach to standardizing data exchange. This is an extremely difficult but important
> task that we have faced. Achieving this goal will elevate the capabilities of all of us to a whole new level. We do
> not want to change your approach but to become a neutral standard where you compose your sub-components according to
> your needs and the clear rules we provide.

## Let's check short code examples

Check for yourself how fast and easy it is to write queries with Hyper Fetch.

---

## Simple Request

```ts
const client = new Client({ url: "https://api.github.com" });

const getRepositoryDetails = client.createRequest()({
  method: "GET",
  url: "/repos/BetterTyped/hyper-fetch",
});

const { data, error, status, extra } = await getRepositoryDetails.send();
```

---

## React Integration

```tsx
import { Client } from "@hyper-fetch/core";

const client = new Client({ url: "https://api.github.com" });

const getRepositoryDetails = client.createRequest()({
  method: "GET",
  url: "/repos/BetterTyped/hyper-fetch",
});

export function RepositoryComponent() {
  const { loading, error, data } = useFetch(getRepositoryDetails);

  if (loading) return "Loading data...";

  if (error) return `Fetching error: ${error.message}`;

  return (
    <div>
      <h1>{data.name}</h1>
      <p>{data.description}</p>
      <strong>{data.subscribers_count}</strong>
    </div>
  );
}
```
