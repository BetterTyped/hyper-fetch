# Infinite Scroll

Infinite scroll is a popular pattern for loading and displaying a large number of items without traditional pagination.
As the user scrolls down, new items are fetched and added to the end of the list. While Hyper-fetch doesn't have a
dedicated `useInfiniteScroll` hook out-of-the-box, you can easily implement this pattern by composing `useSubmit` to
load more data on demand.

:::secondary What you'll learn

1.  How to implement a **"Load More"** feature for paginated data.
2.  How to use **`useSubmit`** to manually trigger fetching for the next page.
3.  How to **append new data** to an existing list in React state.
4.  How to manage **loading states** for a better user experience.

## Implementation with `useSubmit`

A clean way to implement infinite scroll is to use the `useSubmit` hook to fetch new pages when the user clicks a "Load
More" button. This gives us precise control over when data is fetched.

Here is a live example that loads a list of posts and appends more on button click:

```tsx live
function InfinitePostList() {
  const [posts, setPosts] = React.useState([]);
  const [page, setPage] = React.useState(1);
  const [allLoaded, setAllLoaded] = React.useState(false);

  // We use useSubmit to manually trigger the fetch for the next page
  const { submit, submitting } = useSubmit(getPosts);

  const loadMore = async () => {
    const { data: newPosts } = await submit({ queryParams: { page, limit: 5 } });

    if (newPosts && newPosts.length > 0) {
      setPosts((prevPosts) => [...prevPosts, ...newPosts]);
      setPage((prevPage) => prevPage + 1);
    } else {
      setAllLoaded(true);
    }
  };

  // Load the first page on component mount
  React.useEffect(() => {
    loadMore();
  }, []);

  return (
    <div className="border rounded-md">
      <ul className="divide-y divide-gray-200">
        {posts.map((post) => (
          <li key={post.id} className="p-4">
            <p className="font-bold">{post.title}</p>
            <p>{post.body}</p>
          </li>
        ))}
      </ul>

      {submitting && <p className="text-center p-4">Loading...</p>}

      {!allLoaded && (
        <div className="p-4 flex justify-center">
          <button
            className="px-6 py-2 bg-blue-500 text-white rounded hover:bg-blue-600 disabled:bg-gray-400"
            onClick={loadMore}
            disabled={submitting}
          >
            {submitting ? "Loading..." : "Load More"}
          </button>
        </div>
      )}
      {allLoaded && posts.length > 0 && <p className="text-center p-4 text-gray-500">You've reached the end!</p>}
    </div>
  );
}
```

### How it Works

1.  We maintain a `posts` array in our state to hold all the items and a `page` number to track which page to fetch
    next.
2.  We use `useSubmit` because it allows us to trigger the request manually via the `submit` function. This is perfect
    for a "Load More" button.
3.  The `loadMore` function calls `submit` with the current `page`. The `submit` function is a promise, so we can
    `await` its result.
4.  Once we get the `newPosts`, we append them to our existing `posts` array and increment the page number for the next
    fetch.
5.  If the API returns an empty array, we know we've reached the end, and we can stop showing the "Load More" button.
6.  A `useEffect` hook is used to load the initial page of data when the component mounts.

This approach is robust and gives a great user experience by showing a growing list of items.

:::success Congratulations!

You've learned how to build an infinite scroll feature with Hyper-fetch!

- You can create a **"Load More"** pattern for large datasets using `useSubmit`.
- You can manage **paginated data** from an API and display it in a single, growing list.
- You can manually **trigger data fetching** for creating interactive data-driven UIs.
