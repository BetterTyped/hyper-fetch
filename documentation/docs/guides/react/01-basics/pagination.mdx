# Pagination

Pagination is a fundamental feature for displaying large datasets in a manageable way. With Hyper-fetch, implementing
pagination is straightforward. By changing the parameters of your request, such as the page number or offset, `useFetch`
will automatically re-fetch the data for the new page. The built-in caching will also make navigating between previously
visited pages instantaneous.

:::secondary What you'll learn

1.  How to implement **pagination** using the `useFetch` hook.
2.  How to manage the **current page state** in a React component.
3.  How to create **"Next"** and **"Previous"** buttons to navigate through pages.
4.  How Hyper-fetch's **automatic re-fetching** and **caching** simplify pagination logic.

## Example

Let's build a component that displays a paginated list of posts. We'll add buttons to navigate back and forth between
pages.

```tsx live
function PaginatedPosts() {
  const [page, setPage] = React.useState(1);

  // highlight-start
  const { data: posts, loading, error } = useFetch(getPosts.setQueryParams({ page, limit: 5 }));
  // highlight-end

  const goToNextPage = () => {
    setPage((p) => p + 1);
  };

  const goToPrevPage = () => {
    setPage((p) => Math.max(1, p - 1));
  };

  if (error) {
    return <p className="p-4 text-red-500">Failed to load posts.</p>;
  }

  return (
    <div className="border rounded-md">
      <h2 className="text-xl font-bold p-4 border-b">Posts (Page {page})</h2>
      {loading ? (
        <p className="p-4">Loading...</p>
      ) : (
        <ul className="divide-y divide-gray-200">
          {posts?.map((post) => (
            <li key={post.id} className="p-4">
              <p className="font-semibold">{post.title}</p>
            </li>
          ))}
        </ul>
      )}
      <div className="p-4 border-t flex justify-between">
        <button
          className="px-4 py-2 bg-gray-300 rounded disabled:opacity-50"
          onClick={goToPrevPage}
          disabled={page === 1 || loading}
        >
          Previous
        </button>
        <button
          className="px-4 py-2 bg-gray-300 rounded disabled:opacity-50"
          onClick={goToNextPage}
          disabled={!posts || posts.length < 5 || loading}
        >
          Next
        </button>
      </div>
    </div>
  );
}
```

### How It Works

1.  We use a React state variable, `page`, to keep track of the current page number.
2.  The `useFetch` hook is given a request that includes the `page` in its query parameters:
    `getPosts.setQueryParams({ page, limit: 5 })`.
3.  Whenever `page` changes (by clicking the "Next" or "Previous" buttons), the component re-renders.
4.  Hyper-fetch detects that a dependency of the request (`page`) has changed and automatically triggers a new fetch for
    the new page's data.
5.  The `loading` state from `useFetch` is used to give feedback to the user while the new page is being loaded.
6.  The "Next" button is disabled if the current page has fewer items than the limit, indicating we've reached the end.

This declarative approach makes pagination logic clean and easy to manage.

:::success Congratulations!

You've learned how to implement pagination in your React applications with Hyper-fetch!

- You can create a **paginated list** controlled by React state.
- You can leverage **automatic re-fetching** when request parameters change.
- You can build a **user-friendly navigation** for large datasets.
- You understand how Hyper-fetch's **caching** makes navigating between pages fast.
