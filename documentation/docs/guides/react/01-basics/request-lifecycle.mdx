# Request Lifecycle Events

Understanding and reacting to the lifecycle of a request is key to building robust and user-friendly applications.
Hyper-fetch provides a comprehensive set of lifecycle event callbacks on its hooks (`useFetch`, `useSubmit`, etc.) that
allow you to tap into every stage of a request, from the moment it's sent until it's finished.

These callbacks, often called "helper hooks," enable you to trigger side effects, update UI state, or log events at
precise moments.

:::secondary What you'll learn

1.  About the different **stages of a request's lifecycle**.
2.  How to use callbacks like **`onSuccess`**, **`onError`**, and **`onFinished`**.
3.  How to respond to events like **request start** (`onRequestStart`) and **cancellation** (`onAbort`).
4.  How to build a **real-time event log** to visualize the request lifecycle.

## Visualizing the Lifecycle

The best way to understand the lifecycle is to see it in action. Let's build a component that fetches some data and logs
each lifecycle event as it happens. We'll provide buttons to trigger a successful request, a failed request, and to
abort a request.

```tsx live
function LifecycleLogger() {
  const [logs, setLogs] = React.useState([]);

  const addLog = (message) => {
    const timestamp = new Date().toLocaleTimeString();
    setLogs((prev) => [`[${timestamp}] ${message}`, ...prev]);
  };

  // Setup the fetch hook with all the lifecycle callbacks
  // highlight-start
  const { revalidate, abort } = useFetch(getUser, {
    disabled: true, // We will trigger it manually
    onRequestStart: () => addLog("üöÄ Request Started"),
    onSuccess: () => addLog("‚úÖ Request Succeeded"),
    onError: () => addLog("‚ùå Request Errored"),
    onFinished: () => addLog("üèÅ Request Finished (Success or Error)"),
    onAbort: () => addLog("üõë Request Aborted"),
    onOffline: () => addLog("üîå Request Offline"),
  });
  // highlight-end

  const handleFetchSuccess = () => {
    addLog("--- Starting Success Fetch ---");
    revalidate(getUser.setParams({ userId: 1 }));
  };

  const handleFetchError = () => {
    addLog("--- Starting Error Fetch ---");
    // Assuming userId 999 does not exist and will cause an error
    revalidate(getUser.setParams({ userId: 999 }));
  };

  const handleAbort = () => {
    addLog("--- Aborting Fetch ---");
    abort();
  };

  const getLogClass = (log) => {
    if (log.includes("‚úÖ")) return "text-green-600";
    if (log.includes("‚ùå")) return "text-red-600";
    if (log.includes("üöÄ")) return "text-blue-600";
    if (log.includes("üõë")) return "text-yellow-600";
    if (log.includes("üîå")) return "text-orange-600";
    return "text-gray-800";
  };

  return (
    <div className="border rounded-md">
      <div className="p-4 border-b">
        <h2 className="text-xl font-bold mb-2">Lifecycle Event Log</h2>
        <div className="space-x-2">
          <button onClick={handleFetchSuccess} className="px-3 py-1 bg-green-500 text-white rounded">
            Fetch Success
          </button>
          <button onClick={handleFetchError} className="px-3 py-1 bg-red-500 text-white rounded">
            Fetch Error
          </button>
          <button onClick={handleAbort} className="px-3 py-1 bg-yellow-500 text-white rounded">
            Abort
          </button>
          <button onClick={() => setLogs([])} className="px-3 py-1 bg-gray-500 text-white rounded">
            Clear Log
          </button>
        </div>
      </div>
      <div className="p-4 bg-gray-50 h-64 overflow-y-auto font-mono text-sm">
        {logs.map((log, i) => (
          <p key={i} className={getLogClass(log)}>
            {log}
          </p>
        ))}
      </div>
    </div>
  );
}
```

### Key Lifecycle Callbacks

Here's a breakdown of the most commonly used lifecycle callbacks:

- **`onRequestStart`**: Fires as soon as the request is about to be sent. Perfect for showing a loading spinner or
  logging the start of an action.
- **`onSuccess`**: Fires only when the request completes successfully (e.g., a 2xx HTTP status). Ideal for updating
  state with the fetched data or showing a success notification.
- **`onError`**: Fires only when the request fails (e.g., a 4xx/5xx HTTP status, network error). Use this to display an
  error message to the user.
- **`onFinished`**: Fires after _every_ request, regardless of whether it succeeded or failed. It's the equivalent of a
  `finally` block in a promise chain. Great for hiding a loading spinner.
- **`onAbort`**: Fires when a request is manually cancelled using the `abort()` function returned by the hook.
- **`onOffline`**: Fires if a request fails specifically because the browser is offline. This allows you to show a
  specific "You are offline" message.
- **`onUploadProgress` / `onDownloadProgress`**: Fire repeatedly during a file upload or download. See the
  [Progress guide](./progress.mdx) for more details.

By using these callbacks, you can create a highly interactive and informative UI that responds intelligently to the
state of your data fetching.

:::success Congratulations!

You've mastered the Hyper-fetch request lifecycle!

- You can hook into **every stage** of a request's journey.
- You know the difference between **`onSuccess`**, **`onError`**, and **`onFinished`**.
- You can handle specific cases like **aborts** and **offline** states.
- You are equipped to build **complex, state-aware UIs** that responds to data events.
