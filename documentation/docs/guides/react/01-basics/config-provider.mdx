# React Config Provider

In Hyper-fetch, you can set default configurations for hooks using the `<ConfigProvider />` component. This allows you
to create a consistent behavior for data fetching and submission across your entire application, avoiding repetitive
setup in individual components.

:::secondary What you'll learn

1.  How to use the **`<ConfigProvider />`** to set **global configurations** for Hyper-fetch hooks.
2.  What are the **configurable options** for `useFetch` and `useSubmit`.
3.  How to **structure your application** to use the provider effectively.

## Setup

The `<ConfigProvider />` acts as a context wrapper. You should place it at the root of your component tree, for example
in your main `App.tsx` or `index.tsx` file. It takes a `config` prop where you can specify default settings for all
Hyper-fetch hooks.

Here's how you can wrap your application with it:

```tsx
import React from "react";
import ReactDOM from "react-dom/client";
import { ConfigProvider } from "@hyper-fetch/react";

// 1. Define your custom configuration
const customConfig = {
  useFetchConfig: {
    // Default options for all useFetch instances
    revalidateOnFocus: true,
    bounce: true,
    bounceTime: 200,
  },
  useSubmitConfig: {
    // Default options for all useSubmit instances
    debounce: true,
    debounceTime: 300,
  },
};

function App() {
  // Your application components go here
  return <div>...</div>;
}

// 2. Wrap your app with the ConfigProvider
const root = ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById("root"));
root.render(
  <React.StrictMode>
    <ConfigProvider config={customConfig}>
      <App />
    </ConfigProvider>
  </React.StrictMode>,
);
```

The `config` prop gives you granular control over the default behavior of `useFetch`, `useSubmit`, and other hooks,
ensuring that your application maintains a consistent user experience with minimal boilerplate.
