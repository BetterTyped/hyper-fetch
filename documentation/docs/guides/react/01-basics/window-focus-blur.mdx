# Window and Network Events

Modern web applications often need to be aware of their environment. Does the user have the window focused? Is their
network connection stable? Hyper-fetch provides several powerful options in `useFetch` to automatically handle data
fetching based on these events, ensuring your app's data is fresh when it needs to be and that it behaves intelligently
when the user returns to your app or reconnects to the internet.

:::secondary What you'll learn

1.  How to automatically **re-fetch data on window focus**.
2.  How to trigger refreshes on **network reconnection**.
3.  The difference between **`refreshOnFocus`**, **`refreshOnBlur`**, and **`refreshOnReconnect`**.
4.  How `refreshBlurred` affects background refreshing behavior.
5.  How to **combine these options** for robust data synchronization.

## Live Demo

This interactive example demonstrates how the various window and network event options work. Toggle the switches and
then try interacting with the browser window (e.g., switch to another tab and come back) or use your browser's developer
tools to simulate being offline and online.

```tsx
function WindowEventsDemo() {
  const [options, setOptions] = React.useState({
    refresh: true,
    refreshTime: DateInterval.second * 5,
    refreshOnFocus: true,
    refreshOnBlur: false,
    refreshOnReconnect: true,
    refreshBlurred: false,
  });
  const [logs, setLogs] = React.useState([]);

  const addLog = (message) => {
    const timestamp = new Date().toLocaleTimeString();
    setLogs((prev) => [`[${timestamp}] ${message}`, ...prev].slice(0, 10));
  };

  const { data } = useFetch(getActivities, {
    ...options,
    onSuccess: (res) => addLog(`âœ… Fetched: "${res.data[0].name}"`),
  });

  const toggleOption = (option) => {
    setOptions((prev) => ({ ...prev, [option]: !prev[option] }));
  };

  const OptionToggle = ({ name, description }) => (
    <div className="flex items-center justify-between py-2 border-b">
      <div>
        <p className="font-semibold">{name}</p>
        <p className="text-sm text-gray-600">{description}</p>
      </div>
      <button
        onClick={() => toggleOption(name)}
        className={`px-4 py-2 rounded text-white ${options[name] ? "bg-green-500" : "bg-gray-500"}`}
      >
        {options[name] ? "ON" : "OFF"}
      </button>
    </div>
  );

  return (
    <div className="border rounded-md">
      <div className="p-4 border-b">
        <h2 className="text-xl font-bold">Event Options</h2>
        <OptionToggle name="refreshOnFocus" description="Refetch when you return to this tab." />
        <OptionToggle name="refreshOnReconnect" description="Refetch when network connection is restored." />
        <OptionToggle name="refreshOnBlur" description="Refetch when you leave this tab." />
        <OptionToggle
          name="refreshBlurred"
          description="Allow regular refreshing (every 5s) even if tab is not focused."
        />
      </div>
      <div className="p-4 bg-gray-50">
        <h3 className="font-bold mb-2">Event Log (Last 10)</h3>
        <div className="font-mono text-sm space-y-1">
          {logs.map((log, i) => (
            <p key={i}>{log}</p>
          ))}
        </div>
      </div>
    </div>
  );
}
```

### Options Explained

- **`refreshOnFocus`**: (Default: `true`) This is one of the most useful options. When set to `true`, data will be
  automatically re-fetched whenever the user focuses the window (e.g., switches back to your browser tab). This is a
  great way to ensure the data is fresh when the user returns to your app after some time away.

- **`refreshOnReconnect`**: (Default: `true`) If the user loses their network connection and later comes back online,
  this option will automatically trigger a re-fetch. This helps your app gracefully recover from network interruptions.

- **`refreshOnBlur`**: (Default: `false`) When `true`, a re-fetch is triggered the moment the user leaves the window
  (e.g., switches to another tab). This is less common but can be useful if you need to trigger some action or fetch
  data in the background immediately upon user departure.

- **`refreshBlurred`**: (Default: `false`) This option works in conjunction with interval-based refreshing (using
  `refresh` and `refreshTime`). By default, interval refreshing is paused when the window is blurred (not focused) to
  save resources. If you set `refreshBlurred` to `true`, the interval-based refreshing will continue to run even when
  the tab is in the background.

By combining these options, you can create a data-fetching strategy that is both efficient and highly responsive to the
user's context.

:::success Congratulations!

You're now an expert in handling window and network events with Hyper-fetch!

- You can intelligently **re-fetch data** when a user returns to your application.
- Your app can **gracefully handle** network disconnections and reconnections.
- You understand the specific behaviors of **`refreshOnFocus`**, **`refreshOnBlur`**, and **`refreshOnReconnect`**.
- You can control **background data polling** with the `refreshBlurred` option.
