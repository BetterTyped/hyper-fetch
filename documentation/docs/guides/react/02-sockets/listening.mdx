# Socket Listening

Listening to real-time events from your server is a cornerstone of building dynamic, interactive applications. With
Hyper-fetch, the `useListener` hook provides a declarative and powerful way to subscribe to socket events directly
within your React components. It manages the entire lifecycle of the socket connection, from mounting to unmounting, and
gives you fine-grained control over how to respond to incoming data and connection state changes.

:::secondary What you'll learn

1.  How to use the **`useListener`** hook to subscribe to socket events.
2.  How to **update your component's state** with data received from the socket.
3.  How to handle **connection states** like `connecting` and `error`.
4.  How to use helper hooks like **`onEvent`**, **`onError`**, and **`onReconnecting`** for lifecycle management.

## Basic Usage

The `useListener` hook is designed for simplicity. You provide it with a listener `request` from your backend setup, and
it gives you back the connection status and any data that arrives. Here's how you can set up a basic message listener.

In this example, we'll listen for chat messages and display them in a list. The `onEvent` helper hook is the primary way
to access incoming data. It fires every time a new message arrives, allowing you to update your component's state.

```tsx live
function LiveChat() {
  const [messages, setMessages] = React.useState([]);

  // This is our listener, it will be automatically cleaned up on unmount
  const { connected, connecting, error, onEvent, onError, onReconnecting } = useListener(onChatMessage);

  // Here we can listen for incoming messages
  onEvent(({ data }) => {
    setMessages((prev) => [data, ...prev]);
  });

  // Optional: Handle errors
  onError((err) => {
    console.error("Connection error!", err);
  });

  // Optional: Handle reconnecting attempts
  onReconnecting((attempt) => {
    console.log("Attempting to reconnect...", attempt);
  });

  if (connecting) {
    return <p>Connecting to the chat...</p>;
  }

  if (error) {
    return <p className="text-red-500">Error: {error.message}</p>;
  }

  return (
    <div className="w-full">
      <p>Connection status: {connected ? "Connected" : "Disconnected"}</p>
      <h3 className="text-lg font-bold mt-4">Messages:</h3>
      {!messages.length && <p>No messages yet. Waiting for new messages...</p>}
      <div className="flex flex-col-reverse mt-2 max-h-60 overflow-y-auto border p-2 rounded-md">
        {messages.map((message, index) => (
          <div key={index} className="bg-blue-100 p-2 my-1 rounded-md">
            <p className="font-bold">{message.user}</p>
            <p>{message.message}</p>
            <p className="text-xs text-gray-500">{new Date(message.timestamp).toLocaleTimeString()}</p>
          </div>
        ))}
      </div>
    </div>
  );
}
```

In the example above, `onChatMessage` is a pre-defined listener request. You can learn more about creating them in the
[sockets guide](/docs/guides/sockets/listening).

:::success Congratulations!

You now know how to listen for socket events in your React applications!

- You can use **`useListener`** to subscribe to events when a component mounts.
- You can react to incoming data using the **`onEvent`** helper hook.
- You can monitor the connection status with the **`connected`**, **`connecting`**, and **`error`** properties.
- You can add additional logic for errors and reconnections with **`onError`** and **`onReconnecting`**.
