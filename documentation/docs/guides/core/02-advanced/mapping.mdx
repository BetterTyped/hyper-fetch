# Mapping

In Hyper-fetch, you can intercept and modify both outgoing requests and incoming responses. This powerful feature, known
as mapping, allows you to transform data, add or modify headers, and even hydrate data into class models, all without
affecting the core cached data. Mappers can be synchronous or asynchronous, giving you the flexibility to perform
complex data manipulations, such as fetching additional data to enrich a response.

:::secondary What you'll learn

1.  How to **map responses** to transform incoming data.
2.  How to use **asynchronous mappers** to enrich responses with additional data.
3.  How to **hydrate response data** into class models for better data handling.
4.  How to **map requests** to modify outgoing data, such as converting it to `FormData`.
5.  How to dynamically **add headers** to a request within a mapper.

## Response Mapping

You can set the mapping of data returned from the request. This data will not be modified in the cache; it will only be
modified within the given request. This means that the mapping will be included locally and not globally in the cache.

By making two requests to the same place with two different mappers, we can still use everything the library
offersâ€”deduplication, cache, etc. The mapper does not affect other requests, only the one to which it is attached.
Thanks to this, we do not have to change the cache keys for each mapped request.

:::info

Mappers can be asynchronus. This way we can build up bigger responses.

:::

Here's an example of using a response mapper to enrich the user data with a list of products and transform a date string
into a `Date` object.

```typescript
// Let's assume we have this request to fetch products
const getProducts = client.createRequest<ProductModel[]>()({
  method: "GET",
  endpoint: "/products",
});

export const getUser = client
  .createRequest<{ response: UserModel }>()({
    method: "GET",
    endpoint: "/users/:userId",
  })
  .setResponseMapper(async (response) => {
    if (response.data) {
      // Fetch additional data
      const productsResponse = await getProducts.send();
      const products = productsResponse.data || [];

      return {
        ...response,
        data: {
          ...response.data,
          products, // Add custom data to response
          createdAt: new Date(response.data.createdAt), // Always transforms ISO string to Date!
        },
      };
    }
    return response;
  });
```

### Model Hydration

We can hydrate class models, which can parse our data. For example, the `User` class can parse dates from an ISO string
into a `Date` object, generate nicknames or full names, etc. This is a powerful way to work with structured data.

```typescript
class User {
  id: number;
  name: string;
  createdAt: Date;

  constructor(data: UserModel) {
    this.id = data.id;
    this.name = data.name;
    this.createdAt = new Date(data.createdAt);
  }

  get profile() {
    return `${this.name} (since ${this.createdAt.getFullYear()})`;
  }
}

export const getUser = client
  .createRequest<{ response: UserModel }>()({
    method: "GET",
    endpoint: "/users/:userId",
  })
  .setResponseMapper((response) => {
    // Note that we are returning an instance of User, not the plain object.
    // The type in createRequest should be `UserModel`, which is the raw data from the server.
    // The use of the mapper and `User` class will provide the hydrated model to the application.
    if (response.data) {
      return { ...response, data: new User(response.data) };
    }
    return response;
  });
```

## Request Mapping

You can also map requests to make changes to a request before executing it. This allows us to validate the sent data and
change its format or state, for example, to send it as `FormData`.

:::info

Request mappers can also be asynchronous, allowing for complex pre-request logic.

:::

In this example, we convert the request payload into `FormData` and add a custom header before sending the request.

```typescript
export const postUser = client
  .createRequest<{ response: UserModel; payload: UserData }>()({
    method: "POST",
    endpoint: "/users/:userId",
  })
  .setRequestMapper((request) => {
    const formData = new FormData();

    Object.entries(request.data).forEach(([key, value]) => {
      formData.append(key, value);
    });

    // Add custom headers and map data for every request
    return request.setHeaders({ ...request.headers, "X-Better-Typed": "My custom header" }).setData(formData);
  });
```

:::success Congratulations!

You've mastered request and response mapping in Hyper-fetch!

- You can **transform incoming data** using `.setResponseMapper()` without affecting the cache.
- You can **enrich responses** by making additional requests within an asynchronous mapper.
- You can **hydrate data** into class models for more robust data structures.
- You can **modify outgoing requests** using `.setRequestMapper()` to format data or add headers.
- You understand that mappers provide a **local, per-request transformation**, ensuring data consistency across your
  application.
