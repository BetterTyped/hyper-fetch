# Custom Adapter

In Hyper Fetch, an adapter is a class responsible for handling the actual data exchange with a server. While Hyper Fetch
comes with a built-in `http-adapter`, you might need to create a custom adapter to support different protocols (like
WebSockets), integrate with a specific service (like Firebase), or use a different HTTP client (like `axios`).

This guide will walk you through creating your own custom adapter, from a basic setup to advanced typing.

:::secondary What you'll learn

1.  How to create a **custom adapter** for Hyper Fetch using the `Adapter` class.
2.  How to use the `setFetcher` method to **implement the core logic**.
3.  The role of the **adapter bindings** in the adapter lifecycle.
4.  How to **strongly-type your adapter** with custom options and return values.
5.  How to implement **adapter unions** for conditional typing.

## Basic Setup

At its core, an adapter is a class that extends the `Adapter` class and implements the fetching logic. You can connect
any adapter to the client by instantiating it.

Here's a minimal example of a custom adapter:

```ts
import { Adapter, Client } from "@hyper-fetch/core";

const customAdapter = new Adapter({
  name: "custom-adapter",
  defaultMethod: "GET",
  defaultExtra: {},
  systemErrorStatus: 500,
  systemErrorExtra: {},
}).setFetcher(async ({ request, onSuccess }) => {
  onSuccess({
    data: { message: "success" },
    error: null,
    status: 200,
    extra: null,
  });
});

const client = new Client({ url: "http://localhost:3000" }).setAdapter(customAdapter);
```

This adapter doesn't do much—it returns a static response. To make it useful, we need to add logic to actually make a
network request.

## Core Logic with `setFetcher`

The `setFetcher` method is where you'll implement your adapter's core functionality. It takes a callback function that
receives a set of bindings—utilities and request details—to help you build your fetching logic. This approach abstracts
away the complex internal logic of Hyper Fetch and provides a clean way to integrate your adapter.

This ensures that all lifecycle hooks, request queueing, and other features work correctly.

Let's implement a simple adapter using the native `fetch` API:

```ts
import { Adapter, Client, RequestInstance } from "@hyper-fetch/core";
import { User } from "shared";

const fetchAdapter = new Adapter({
  name: "fetch-adapter",
  defaultMethod: "GET",
  defaultExtra: {},
  systemErrorStatus: 500,
  systemErrorExtra: {},
}).setFetcher(async ({ request, headers, payload, onSuccess, onError }) => {
  const { client, endpoint, method } = request;
  const fullUrl = `${client.url}${endpoint}`;

  try {
    const response = await fetch(fullUrl, {
      method,
      headers: headers as HeadersInit,
      body: JSON.stringify(payload),
    });

    const data = await response.json();

    if (response.ok) {
      onSuccess({ data, status: response.status, extra: null });
    } else {
      onError({ error: data, status: response.status, extra: null });
    }
  } catch (error) {
    onError({ error, status: 0, extra: null });
  }
});

const client = new Client({ url: "http://localhost:3000" }).setAdapter(fetchAdapter);
```

## Adapter Bindings

The callback passed to `setFetcher` receives an object with a set of utilities and request details. Here are the key
properties you'll use:

- **Core Request Data**: `request`, `headers`, `payload`, and `adapterOptions` provide the essential details of the
  request.
- **Lifecycle Callbacks**: A set of `on...` callbacks (`onSuccess`, `onError`, `onAbort`, `onTimeout`, etc.) that you
  must use to report the outcome of the request.
- **Abort Logic**: `createAbortListener` allows you to implement request cancellation.
- **Progress Callbacks**: `onRequestProgress` and `onResponseProgress` for tracking upload and download progress.

## Advanced Typing

The `Adapter` class is a generic type that allows you to define custom options for your adapter, specify the structure
of the `extra` return property, and more. This enables you to create strongly-typed adapters that are both powerful and
easy to use.

Here's how you can define an adapter with custom options and extra data:

```ts
import { Adapter, HttpMethodsType, HttpStatusType, QueryParamsType } from "@hyper-fetch/core";

type MyCustomAdapterOptions = {
  timeout?: number;
  someOtherOption?: boolean;
};

type MyCustomExtra = {
  headers: Headers;
  raw: string;
};

const customHttpAdapter = new Adapter<
  MyCustomAdapterOptions,
  HttpMethodsType,
  HttpStatusType,
  MyCustomExtra,
  QueryParamsType
>({
  name: "custom-http-adapter",
  defaultMethod: "GET",
  defaultExtra: { headers: new Headers(), raw: "" },
  systemErrorStatus: 500,
  systemErrorExtra: { headers: new Headers(), raw: "" },
});

const client = new Client({ url: "https://api.example.com" }).setAdapter(customHttpAdapter);
```

### Adapter Unions

For more complex scenarios, you can create a union of `Adapter` types. This is a powerful feature used extensively in
the `firebase-adapter`. However, creating a single adapter instance that can handle different configurations requires a
factory function or a class that internally manages different adapter instances. The simplest way to achieve union-like
behavior is to define a type and then create instances that conform to different parts of that union.

```ts
import { Adapter, HttpMethodsType, HttpStatusType, QueryParamsType } from "@hyper-fetch/core";

type MyAdapter =
  | Adapter<{ timeout?: number }, "GET", HttpStatusType, { raw: string }, QueryParamsType>
  | Adapter<{ headers?: Headers }, "POST", HttpStatusType, { json: string }, QueryParamsType>;

const getAdapter: MyAdapter = new Adapter({
  name: "get-adapter",
  defaultMethod: "GET",
  defaultExtra: { raw: "" },
  systemErrorStatus: 500,
  systemErrorExtra: { raw: "" },
});
const postAdapter: MyAdapter = new Adapter({
  name: "post-adapter",
  defaultMethod: "POST",
  defaultExtra: { json: "" },
  systemErrorStatus: 500,
  systemErrorExtra: { json: "" },
});

const client = new Client({ url: "https://api.example.com" }).setAdapter(getAdapter);

// This request will have the type of the first union member
const request1 = client.createRequest()({
  endpoint: "/product",
  method: "GET",
  adapterOptions: { timeout: 1000 },
});
const { extra: extra1 } = await request1.send();
// extra1 is { raw: string }

// To use the post adapter, you would need to set it on the client
client.setAdapter(postAdapter);

// This request will have the type of the second union member
const request2 = client.createRequest()({
  endpoint: "/user",
  method: "POST",
  adapterOptions: { headers: new Headers() },
});
const { extra: extra2 } = await request2.send();
// extra2 is { json: string }
```
