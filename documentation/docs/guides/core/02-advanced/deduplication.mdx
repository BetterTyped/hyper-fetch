# Deduplication

When we need to limit and optimize the number of requests sent to a server, we can use **deduplication**. This feature,
when enabled, combines multiple identical requests made in a short period into a single request, preventing redundant
data fetching and reducing server load. We can enable it by setting the `deduplicate: true` option on a request.

:::secondary What you'll learn

1.  How to **enable deduplication** on a request to optimize data fetching.
2.  How to use `deduplicateTime` to **control the time window** for combining requests.
3.  How to observe the effects of deduplication in a **real-world scenario**.

:::

## Setup

To enable deduplication, you need to set the `deduplicate` option to `true` on your request. This tells Hyper-fetch to
prevent identical requests from being sent multiple times within a short timeframe.

```ts
const getUsers = client.createRequest()({
  endpoint: "/users",
  deduplicate: true,
});
```

## How it works

Let's see how deduplication works in practice. In the example below, we call the `getUsers.send()` method four times in
quick succession. Since `deduplicate` is enabled, Hyper-fetch will only send a single request to the backend. The
subsequent calls will receive the response from the first request.

```ts live
// We are using pre-build 'getUsers' request and 'client' instance

// highlight-start
const getUsers = client.createRequest()({
  endpoint: "/users",
  deduplicate: true,
});
// highlight-end

// Multiple calls of the same request
getUsers.send({
  onStart: ({ G, request }) => {
    console.log("Request starting...", { G, request });
  },
});
getUsers.send();
getUsers.send();
getUsers.send();

// Only a single request will be sent to the backend,
// and you will see only one "Request starting..." log in the console.
```

## Deduplication Time

By default, deduplication occurs over a very short period (16ms). However, you can customize this window using the
`deduplicateTime` option. This allows you to control how long Hyper-fetch should wait for identical requests to be
deduplicated.

In this example, we set `deduplicateTime` to 2000 milliseconds. Any identical request made within this window will be
deduplicated.

```ts live
// We are using pre-build 'getUsers' request and 'client' instance

// highlight-start
const getUsersWithTime = client.createRequest()({
  endpoint: "/users",
  deduplicate: true,
  deduplicateTime: 2000,
});
// highlight-end

getUsersWithTime.send({
  onStart: ({ G, request }) => {
    console.log("Request starting with deduplicateTime...", { G, request });
  },
});

setTimeout(() => {
  getUsersWithTime.send({
    onStart: ({ G, request }) => {
      // This will not be logged because it's within the 2000ms window
      console.log("Second request starting...", { G, request });
    },
  });
}, 500);
```

:::success Congratulations!

You've learned how to use request deduplication in Hyper-fetch!

- You can **enable deduplication** with the `deduplicate: true` option.
- You can **customize the deduplication window** using `deduplicateTime`.
- You understand how deduplication **optimizes network requests** by bundling identical calls.
