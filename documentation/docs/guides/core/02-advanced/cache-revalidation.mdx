# Cache Revalidation

When building dynamic applications, keeping the data displayed to the user up-to-date is crucial. Data can become stale
for many reasonsâ€”another user might have updated it, a background process changed it, or the current user performed an
action that invalidates the existing view. Hyper-fetch provides powerful and flexible cache revalidation mechanisms to
ensure your app's data is always fresh.

:::secondary What you'll learn

1.  What **cache revalidation** is and why it's essential.
2.  How to revalidate the cache for a specific request using `client.cache.revalidate`.
3.  How to perform revalidation in plain TypeScript with `client.cache.revalidate`.
4.  Advanced revalidation techniques using **Regular Expressions (RegExp)** to invalidate multiple cache entries at
    once.

## The Basics

Cache revalidation is the process of marking cached data as stale and triggering a re-fetch to get the fresh version
from the server. This is typically done after a data mutation (like creating, updating, or deleting a resource) to
ensure the UI reflects the latest state.

In Hyper-fetch, every request that is cached gets a unique `cacheKey`. This key is used to identify and manage the
cached data. Revalidation works by targeting these keys.

## Revalidation

In a vanilla TypeScript environment, you can perform cache revalidation directly on the client instance.

```typescript
import { client, getUsers } from "./api"; // Your API setup

// ... after some operation that invalidates the users
client.cache.revalidate(getUsers);

// You can also use a cacheKey or RegExp
client.cache.revalidate(getUsers.cacheKey);
client.cache.revalidate(new RegExp("/users"));
```

### Example

Let's see it in action. Below, we fetch a list of users. When we add a new user, we call `revalidate()` to refresh the
list.

```typescript
const getUsers = client.createRequest()({
  endpoint: "/users",
  method: "GET",
});

const addUser = client.createRequest()({
  endpoint: "/users",
  method: "POST",
});

// 1. First, let's fetch the users and cache the response
await getUsers.send({
  onSuccess: (response) => {
    console.log("Initial users list:", response.data);
  },
});

// 2. Now, let's add a new user
await addUser.send({
  data: { name: "New User" },
  onSuccess: () => {
    console.log("New user added successfully.");
    // 3. After adding, we revalidate the users list
    // This will trigger a new fetch for the 'getUsers' request
    client.cache.revalidate(getUsers, {
      onSuccess: (response) => {
        // This onSuccess is for the revalidation fetch
        toast({ title: "Users list revalidated", message: "Fetched latest users.", type: "success" });
        console.log("Revalidated users list:", response.data);
      },
    });
  },
});
```

## Advanced Revalidation with RegExp

Sometimes you need to invalidate multiple cache entries that follow a pattern. For instance, you might have cached data
for individual items (`/users/1`, `/users/2`) and a list of all items (`/users`). A `RegExp` is perfect for this.

Imagine you have requests for a list of articles and for individual articles:

```ts
const getArticles = client.createRequest()({
  method: "GET",
  endpoint: "/articles",
});

const getArticle = client.createRequest()({
  method: "GET",
  endpoint: "/articles/:id",
});
```

When a single article is updated, you might want to revalidate both the list and that specific article's cache, as well
as any other related paginated lists.

```ts
// Let's say we updated article with id '1'
const updatedArticleId = 1;

// This will revalidate every cache entry whose key starts with `GET_/articles`
// 1. The main list: `GET_/articles`
// 2. A specific article: `GET_/articles/1`
// 3. Paginated lists: `GET_/articles?page=1`, `GET_/articles?page=2`, etc.
client.cache.revalidate(new RegExp("GET_/articles"));
```

This powerful feature helps you keep your cache consistent with minimal effort.

:::success Congratulations!

You've learned how to handle cache revalidation in Hyper-fetch!

1.  You can revalidate cache programmatically using `client.cache.revalidate` in **plain TypeScript**.
2.  You can target specific requests by passing the **request instance**, its **`cacheKey`**, or using a **RegExp**.
3.  You can implement **advanced revalidation strategies** to keep complex UIs in sync.
