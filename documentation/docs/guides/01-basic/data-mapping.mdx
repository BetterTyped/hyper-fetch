# Data Mapping

### Changing data before sending it to server

We often encounter the need to `map` data before sending it to the server. This is usually required for two reasons.

One of them is `breaking changes to the server API`. This may require many updates to our existing code,
which can be dangerous for the application and introduce **regression**.

Another case is sending `FormData`, which is impossible to represent in the form of an exact interface in terms of the
fields it contains. In order not to send something that is equivalent to the type `any`, we can specify the correct type
in the request and then map everything to `FormData` just before it gets added to the **[Dispatcher](/documentation/02-core/dispatcher.mdx)**.

This ensures very `type-safe` and `flexible` application development.

### Set payload data mapper

The following example shows the implementation for `FormData`:

```ts
export const postUserProfile = client
  .createRequest<{response: boolean, payload: UserProfile}>()({
    method: "PATCH",
    endpoint: "/users/profile/:userId",
  })
  .setDataMapper((data) => {
    // Transform data:UserProfile into FormData
    const formData = new FormData();

    Object.entries(data).forEach(([key, value]) => {
      formData.append(key, value);
    });

    // Return new data format
    return formData;
  });
```

### Map whole request

The example below shows the implementation of request mapping. We can make each `postUserProfile` request add custom
headers (or any other value) to the request before sending it later (when we use it in our application).
This allows us to implement mappers, validators, and any async logic. Throwing an error makes the request class return an error,
just as weâ€™d get from the "real" query.

```ts
export const postUserProfile = client
  .createRequest<{response: boolean, payload: UserProfile}>()({
    method: "PATCH",
    endpoint: "/users/profile/:userId",
  })
  .setRequestMapper((request) => {
    return request.setHeaders({ ...request.headers, "X-Better-Typed": "My custom header" });
  });
```
