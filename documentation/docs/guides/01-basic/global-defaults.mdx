### Use global defaults for request

Adding global configs can significantly limit application setup. For the greatest flexibility in configurations created
for larger and more complex applications, global configs are added through callbacks based on request data. This allows
us the flexibility to, for example, make one default configuration for requests using the get method and another default
config for the requests using other methods.

Remember: Global configurations are overwritten by request settings, so the options that we set will be applied only to
requests that do not have settings specified in their options.

### Example

```ts
export const client = new Client({ url }).setRequestDefaultOptions((requestOptions) => {
  if (requestOptions.method === "GET") {
    return {
      deduplicate: true,
      staleTime: 20000,
      retry: 3,
    };
  }

  return {
    deduplicate: false,
    cache: false,
    retry: 0,
  };
});
```

### Add your own key mappers

Data and requests made within our library are organized by keys. Each key is generated from request metadata, such as
parameters, query parameters, endpoints, and methods. They can be replaced by the way you choose to segregate and
organize data with your own key mappers.

Note: Keys must be a string value.

```ts
client.setQueueKeyMapper((request) => `Custom_Key_${request.method}_${request.endpoint}`);
client.setAbortKeyMapper((request) => `Abort_Key_${request.method}_${request.endpoint}`);
client.setCacheKeyMapper((request) => `Abort_Key_${request.method}_${request.endpoint}`);
client.setEffectKeyMapper((request) => `Abort_Key_${request.method}_${request.endpoint}`);
```
