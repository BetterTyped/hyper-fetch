# Retries

---

### Retry request on error

**Retries** gives us possibility to send another request in case of previous failure. This way we can ensure that in
some situation we can get successful response no matter of previous failures.

On the request, we can define number of attempts and the interval between subsequent requests. We can add these options
on creation or through the dynamic `setRetry` and `setRetryTime` methods.

### Example

```ts
const createUser = client.createRequest()({ endpoint: "/users", retry: 4, retryTime: DateInterval.second * 3 });

// OR

const newRequest = createUser.setRetry(1).setRetryTime(DateInterval.minute);
```
