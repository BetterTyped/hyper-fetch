title: Optimistic Approach
sidebar_label: Optimistic Approach

Optimistic approach allows us to make instant changes to the UI, before receiving data from the server. In this way, in
the example, when removing a user, he is removed from the list immediately after clicking, which makes the application
"faster" and more responsive to the actions of our users.

### Example

```tsx
function UserTableRow({ user }) {
  const [isDeleted, setDeleted] = useState(false);

  const { submit, onSubmitRequestStart, onSubmitError, onSubmitSuccess, revalidate } = useSubmit(
    deleteUser.setParams({ userId: user.id }),
  );

  onSubmitRequestStart(() => {
    // Set user row as deleted right when request starts
    setDeleted(true);
  });

  onSubmitError(() => {
    // When it fails, recover state
    setDeleted(false);
  });

  onSubmitSuccess(() => {
    // When it's successful, just revalidate users list to pull new page data
    revalidate(new RegExp("/users"));
  });

  if (isDeleted) {
    return null;
  }

  return (
    <tr className="row">
      <td>{user.name}</td>
      <td>{user.age}</td>
      <td>{user.email}</td>
      <td>{user.active}</td>
      <td>{user.lastLogin}</td>
      <td>
        <button onClick={() => submit()}>Delete</button>
      </td>
    </tr>
  );
}
```
