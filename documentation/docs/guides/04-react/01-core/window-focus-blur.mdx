Sometimes we want to react to events related to the active window. Then we can use options in useFetch such as
`refreshBlurred`, `refreshOnBlur`, `refreshOnFocus` and `refreshOnReconnect`.

### `refreshBlurred`

This options allow our hook to refresh data even if user blurred our window.

### `refreshOnBlur`

This options allow our hook to trigger refresh data exactly when user blur our window.

### `refreshOnFocus`

This options allow our hook to trigger refresh data exactly when user focus our window.

### `refreshOnReconnect`

This options allow our hook to trigger refresh data exactly when network is restored.

### Example

```tsx
const { data, error, loading } = useFetch(getList, {
  refreshBlurred: true,
  refreshOnBlur: true,
  refreshOnFocus: true,
  refreshOnReconnect: true,
});
```
