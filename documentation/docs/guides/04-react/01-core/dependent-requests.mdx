title: Dependent Requests
---

`Dependent requests` are needed when fetching some data from the server depends on other data that we need to receive
first. This way we need to hold requesting until we get necessary data.

---

### Example

```tsx
import { getCurrentUser } from "api/users";
import { getUserProducts } from "api/products";

...

const { data: user } = useFetch(getCurrentUser)

const { data: products } = useFetch(getUser.setParams({ userId: user?.id }), {
  disabled: !user
})

```
