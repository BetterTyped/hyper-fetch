With the the `onDownloadProgress` and `onUploadProgress` methods available on the useFetch you can get parsed and
prepared to display values of the estimated time for finalizing the request download or upload.

It will return you the percentage value of the request progress, estimated time left to the end of the task and size of
it that left to be uploaded or downloaded in bytes.

const { data, error, loading, onDownloadProgress, onUploadProgress } = useFetch(getFile);

onDownloadProgress((progress) => {
  console.log(payload); // { progress, timeLeft, sizeLeft }
});

onUploadProgress((progress) => {
  console.log(payload); // { progress, timeLeft, sizeLeft }
});
```
