# Prefetching

**Prefetching** in Hyper Fetch is very easy to achieve. To prefetch query, we need to
`just execute the request in the place we would like`. In this way, we will keep the standard flow of the request
through our dispatching, which will be handled with all features available.

### Example

```ts
import { getUsers } from "./users.server";

// Add this in the right place and simply prefetch the data
// keeping standard flow and loading / caching events to be emitted properly
getUsers.send();
```
