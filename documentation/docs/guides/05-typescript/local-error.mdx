title: Local Error
---

When our endpoint can return an error that is only valid for it, we can use local errors that are closely related to one
request. It does not replace the global error but extends it.

The most common case are forms which, apart from basic errors from the server, can return specific field errors of a
given form. This error is only applicable to that particular location.

### Example

```ts
type LocalErrorType = {
  errors: {
    name?: string;
    email?: string;
    age?: string;
  };
};

const postUser = client.createRequest<ResponseType, RequestType, LocalErrorType>()({
  method: "POST",
  endpoint: "/users",
});
```
