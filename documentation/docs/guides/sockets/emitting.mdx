# Emitting Events

In real-time applications, you often need to send data from the client to the server. With Hyper-Fetch's socket module,
you can **emit events** to send data, and optionally.

:::secondary What you'll learn

1.  How to create an **emitter** to send events.
2.  How to **send data** with an event.
3.  How to handle **server acknowledgments**.
4.  The difference between using **`.setPayload()`** and passing data directly to **`.emit()`**.
5.  How to use **parameters** in event topics.

## Creating an Emitter

First, you need to create an `emitter` instance. An emitter is responsible for sending events to a specific `topic` on
your server. You can define the types for the data you're sending.

Let's create an emitter for a chat application.

```typescript
//highlight-start
type ChatMessageType = {
  message: string;
};
//highlight-end

const sendChatMessage = socketInstance.createEmitter<ChatMessageType>()({
  endpoint: "chat-message", // topic of the event
});
```

## Sending Data

There are two main ways to send data with an emitter:

1.  **Using `.setPayload()`**: You can prepare the emitter with data before sending it. This is useful if you want to
    create a reusable emitter instance with predefined data.
2.  **Passing data to `.emit()`**: You can pass the data directly to the `.emit()` method. This is convenient for
    one-time emissions.

### 1. Using `.setPayload()`

You can use the `.setPayload()` method to attach data to the emitter. This method returns a _new_ emitter instance with
the data, so the original emitter remains unchanged.

```typescript live
const emitterWithPayload = sendChatMessage.setPayload({ message: "Hello from .setPayload()!" });

emitterWithPayload.emit(
  // No need to pass data here as it's already set
  {},
  // Acknowledgement callback
  (error, data) => {
    if (error) {
      console.error("Error sending message:", error);
      return;
    }
    console.log("Server acknowledgment:", data);
  },
);
```

### 2. Passing Data to `.emit()`

Alternatively, you can pass the data as the first argument to the `.emit()` method.

```typescript live
sendChatMessage.emit(
  // The data to be sent
  { message: "Hello from .emit()!" },
  // Acknowledgement callback
  (error, data) => {
    if (error) {
      console.error("Error sending message:", error);
      return;
    }
    console.log("Server acknowledgment:", data);
  },
);
```

## Using Parameters in Topics

Sometimes, you need to send events to dynamic topics, for example, to a specific user or a specific chat room. You can
define parameters in the `topic` string, similar to how you define routes in a web framework.

Let's create an emitter to send a private message to a specific user.

```typescript
const sendPrivateMessage = socketInstance.createEmitter<{ message: string }>()({
  endpoint: "private-message/:userId",
});
```

You can then set the `userId` parameter when you emit the event:

```typescript live
const privateMessageEmitter = sendPrivateMessage.setParams({ userId: "user-123" });

privateMessageEmitter.emit({ message: "This is a private message!" });
```

When this event is sent, `user-123` will be substituted into the topic, and the event will be sent to
`private-message/user-123`.

:::success Congratulations!

You've learned how to emit events with Hyper-Fetch Sockets!

- You can create an **emitter** for a specific event topic.
- You can send data using **`.setPayload()`** or by passing it directly to **`.emit()`**.
- You can use **parameters in topics** to send events to dynamic endpoints.
