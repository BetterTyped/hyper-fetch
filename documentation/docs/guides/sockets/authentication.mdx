# Socket Authentication

Authenticating web socket connections is crucial for securing real-time applications. Hyper-fetch provides a
straightforward way to handle socket authentication, allowing you to pass authentication data during the initial
connection and update it dynamically when needed. This guide will walk you through the process of setting up and
managing authentication for your socket connections.

:::secondary What you'll learn

1.  How to provide **initial authentication data** when creating a socket instance.
2.  How to **dynamically update authentication** details for a live socket connection.
3.  How Hyper-fetch automatically handles **reconnection** when authentication data changes.

## Initial Authentication

When establishing a socket connection, you can provide authentication data, such as a token, through the `auth` option
in the `Socket` constructor. This data is sent to the server as query parameters during the connection handshake.

Here's how you can set it up:

```tsx live
import { Socket } from "@hyper-fetch/sockets";

const token = "your-initial-auth-token";

const socket = new Socket({
  url: "ws://localhost:8080/auth-socket",
  auth: { token },
});

socket.onOpen(() => {
  console.log("Socket connected with token!");
});

socket.onClose(() => {
  console.log("Socket disconnected");
});
```

In this example, the `auth` object containing the token is passed to the server when the socket attempts to connect. The
server can then use this information to verify the client's identity.

## Dynamic Authentication Updates

Authentication tokens or credentials can expire or change during the application's lifecycle. Hyper-fetch allows you to
update the authentication data for an existing socket instance using the `setAuth` method.

When you call `setAuth` with new data, Hyper-fetch will automatically disconnect the current socket and reconnect with
the updated authentication details.

```tsx live
import { Socket } from "@hyper-fetch/sockets";

const initialToken = "your-initial-auth-token";

const socket = new Socket({
  url: "ws://localhost:8080/auth-socket",
  auth: { token: initialToken },
});

socket.onOpen(() => {
  console.log("Socket connected!");
});

socket.onClose(() => {
  console.log("Socket disconnected");
});

// Later in your application, you might get a new token
const updatedToken = "your-new-auth-token";

// Update the auth data and trigger a reconnection
socket.setAuth({ token: updatedToken });
```

This seamless reconnection ensures that your application maintains a valid authenticated session without manual
intervention. The `setAuth` method is particularly useful in scenarios where you need to refresh tokens periodically.

:::success Congratulations!

You now know how to handle authentication in Hyper-fetch sockets.

- You can provide **initial authentication credentials** using the `auth` option.
- You can dynamically update authentication data with the **`setAuth` method**.
- You understand that changing authentication details **triggers an automatic reconnection**.
