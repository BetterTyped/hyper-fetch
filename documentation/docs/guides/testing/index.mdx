Testing is one of the best things in Hyper Fetch. With our architecture and focus on global singleton structure, tests
can be largely based on the application’s configuration. This means tests are no longer sensitive to micro-changes (like
changing endpoints or types). Everything reacts and adapts to tests or shows the appropriate error – making tests easier
to maintain and faster to write.

:::secondary What you'll learn

1.  The **benefits** of testing with Hyper Fetch.
2.  How to **isolate tests** to ensure they are deterministic.
3.  How to **mock API requests** for reliable and fast tests.
