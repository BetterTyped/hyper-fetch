title: Acknowledgements
---

Use the `acknowledgements` by passing the second parameter to the emitting method.

:::caution

Make sure your server is supporting the acknowledgements! When using default adapter, make sure you pass the id of the
event in returning event, when using custom adapters, you have to implement according to it's specification.

:::

```tsx
sendChatMessage.emit({ data: { messsage: "some message" } }, (error, data) => {
  if (error) {
    alert("No server response!");
  } else {
    alert("Message received on server.");
  }
});
```
