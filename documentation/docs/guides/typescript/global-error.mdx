# Global Error

When building applications, handling errors consistently is crucial. Hyper-fetch allows you to define a **global error
type** that can be propagated across all your requests. This ensures that you have a single source of truth for error
shapes, making error handling more predictable and robust. We configure this during the client setup.

:::secondary What you'll learn

1.  How to define a **global error type** for all requests.
2.  How to **configure the client** with the global error type.
3.  Why it's important to include **native `Error` types** for unexpected issues.

### Example

Here is how to set up a global error type on the client. This type will be inferred by all requests created from this
client instance.

```ts
// import { createClient } from '@hyper-fetch/core';

// 1. Let's assume our backend returns errors in this shape
type MyApiError = {
  message: string;
  code: number;
  timestamp: string;
};

// 2. We should also account for network errors or other unexpected issues
type GlobalErrorType = MyApiError | Error;

// 3. Now, we create a client and pass our global error type to it.
// This generic will be propagated to all requests created from this client instance.
// highlight-start
export const client = createClient()({
  url: "https://api.example.com",
}).setExtra<{ error: GlobalErrorType }>();
// highlight-end

// 4. Example usage
const request = client.createRequest()({
  endpoint: "/users/1",
});

// The `error` property will now be correctly typed as `GlobalErrorType`
const { data, error } = await request.send();

if (error) {
  if (error instanceof Error) {
    // Handle native Error
    console.error("A network or unexpected error occurred:", error.message);
  } else {
    // Handle our custom API error
    console.error(`API Error: ${error.message} (Code: ${error.code})`);
  }
}
```

:::success Congratulations!

You've learned how to set up global error types in Hyper-fetch!

- You can define a **centralized error type** for all your requests.
- You know how to **configure the client** to use this global error type.
- You can handle both **custom API errors** and **native `Error` objects** gracefully.
